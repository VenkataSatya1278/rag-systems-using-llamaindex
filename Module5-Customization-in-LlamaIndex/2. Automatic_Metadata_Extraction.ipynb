      "More about evals\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many benchmarks in the field of language modeling. Some notable ones are:\n",
      "\n",
      "MMLU: A set of 57 tasks that span elementary math, US history, computer science, law, and more. To perform well, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem-solving ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "EleutherAI Eval: Unified framework to test models via zero/few-shot settings on 200 tasks. Incorporates a large number of evals including BigBench, MMLU, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "HELM: Instead of specific tasks and metrics, HELM offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs by evaluating them across domains. Metrics include accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, etc. Tasks include Q&A, information retrieval, summarization, text classification, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "AlpacaEval: Automated evaluation framework which measures how often a strong LLM (e.g., GPT-4) prefers the output of one model over a reference model. Metrics include win rate, bias, latency, price, variance, etc. Validated to have high agreement with 20k human annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can group metrics into two categories: context-dependent or context-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context-dependent: These take context into account. They‚Äôre often proposed for a specific task; repurposing them for other tasks will require some adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context-free: These aren‚Äôt tied to the context when evaluating generated output; they only compare the output with the provided gold references. As they‚Äôre task agnostic, they‚Äôre easier to apply to a wide variety of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get a better sense of these metrics (and their potential shortfalls), we‚Äôll explore a few of the commonly used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and MoverScore.\n",
      "\n",
      "BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a precision-based metric: It counts the number of n-grams in the generated output that also show up in the reference, and then divides it by the total number of words in the output. It‚Äôs predominantly used in machine translation and remains a popular metric due to its cost-effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, precision for various values of \\(n\\) is computed:\n",
      "\\[\\text{precision}_n = \\frac{\\sum_{p \\in \\text{output}} \\sum_{\\text{n-gram} \\in p} \\text{Count}_{\\text{clip}} (\\text{n-gram})}{\\sum_{p \\in \\text{output}} \\sum_{\\text{n-gram} \\in p} \\text{Count}(\\text{n-gram})}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "\\(Count_{clip}(\\text{n-gram})\\) is clipped by the maximum number of times an n-gram appears in any corresponding reference sentence.\n",
      "\\[\\text{Count}_{\\text{clip}}(n\\text{-gram}) = \\min \\left(\\text{matched } n\\text{-gram count}, \\max_{r \\in R} \\left(n\\text{-gram count in } r\\right)\\right)\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we‚Äôve computed precision at various \\(n\\), a final BLEU-N score is computed as the geometric mean of all the \\(precision_n\\) scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since precision relies solely on n-grams and doesn‚Äôt consider the length of the generated output, an output containing just one unigram of a common word (like a stop word) would achieve perfect precision. This can be misleading and encourage outputs that contain fewer words to increase BLEU scores. To counter this, a brevity penalty is added to penalize excessively short sentences.\n",
      "\\[BP =\n",
      "\\begin{cases}\n",
      "1 & \\text{if } |p| > |r| \\\\\n",
      "e^{1-\\frac{|r|}{|p|}} & \\text{otherwise}\n",
      "\\end{cases}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the final formula is:\n",
      "\\[\\text{BLEU-N} = BP \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{N} W_n \\log(\\text{precision}_n)\\right)\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): In contrast to BLEU, ROUGE is recall-oriented. It counts the number of words in the reference that also occur in the output. It‚Äôs typically used to assess automatic summarization tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several ROUGE variants. ROUGE-N is most similar to BLEU in that it also counts the number of matching n-grams between the output and the reference.\n",
      "\\[\\text{ROUGE-N} = \\frac{\\sum_{s_r \\in \\text{references}} \\sum_{n\\text{-gram} \\in s_r} \\text{Count}_{\\text{match}} (n\\text{-gram})}{\\sum_{s_r \\in \\text{references}} \\sum_{n\\text{-gram} \\in s_r} \\text{Count} (n\\text{-gram})}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other variants include:\n",
      "\n",
      "ROUGE-L: This measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the output and the reference. It considers sentence-level structure similarity and zeros in on the longest series of co-occurring in-sequence n-grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROUGE-S: This measures the skip-bigram between the output and reference. Skip-bigrams are pairs of words that maintain their sentence order regardless of the words that might be sandwiched between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "BERTScore is an embedding-based metric that uses cosine similarity to compare each token or n-gram in the generated output with the reference sentence. There are three components to BERTScore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall: Average cosine similarity between each token in the reference and its closest match in the generated output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Precision: Average cosine similarity between each token in the generated output and its nearest match in the reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "F1: Harmonic mean of recall and precision\n",
      "\n",
      "BERTScore is useful because it can account for synonyms and paraphrasing. Simpler metrics like BLEU and ROUGE can‚Äôt do this due to their reliance on exact matches. BERTScore has been shown to have better correlation for tasks such as image captioning and machine translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "MoverScore also uses contextualized embeddings to compute the distance between tokens in the generated output and reference. But unlike BERTScore, which is based on one-to-one matching (or ‚Äúhard alignment‚Äù) of tokens, MoverScore allows for many-to-one matching (or ‚Äúsoft alignment‚Äù).\n",
      "\n",
      "BERTScore (left) vs. MoverScore (right; source)\n",
      "\n",
      "MoverScore enables the mapping of semantically related words in one sequence to their counterparts in another sequence. It does this by solving a constrained optimization problem that finds the minimum effort to transform one text into another. The idea is to measure the distance that words would have to move to convert one sequence to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are several pitfalls to using these conventional benchmarks and metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there‚Äôs poor correlation between these metrics and human judgments. BLEU, ROUGE, and others have had negative correlation with how humans evaluate fluency. They also showed moderate to less correlation with human adequacy scores. In particular, BLEU and ROUGE have low correlation with tasks that require creativity and diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, these metrics often have poor adaptability to a wider variety of tasks. Adopting a metric proposed for one task to another is not always prudent. For example, exact match metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE are a poor fit for tasks like abstractive summarization or dialogue. Since they‚Äôre based on n-gram overlap between output and reference, they don‚Äôt make sense for a dialogue task where a wide variety of responses are possible. An output can have zero n-gram overlap with the reference but yet be a good response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, these metrics have poor reproducibility. Even for the same metric, high variance is reported across different studies, possibly due to variations in human judgment collection or metric parameter settings. Another study of ROUGE scores across 2,000 studies found that scores were hard to reproduce, difficult to compare, and often incorrect because evals were often conducted with untested, incorrect ROUGE implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dimensions of model evaluations with ROUGE (source)\n",
      "\n",
      "And even with recent benchmarks such as MMLU, the same model can get significantly different scores based on the eval implementation. Huggingface compared the original MMLU implementation with the HELM and EleutherAI implementations and found that the same example could have different prompts across various providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different prompts for the same question across MMLU implementations (source)\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the evaluation approach differed across all three benchmarks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Original MMLU: Compares predicted probabilities on the answers only (A, B, C, D)\n",
      "\n",
      "HELM: Uses the next token probabilities from the model and picks the token with the highest probability, even if it‚Äôs not one of the options.\n",
      "\n",
      "EleutherAI: Computes probability of the full answer sequence (i.e., a letter followed by the answer text) for each answer. Then, pick answer with highest probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different eval for the same question across MMLU implementations (source)\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, even for the same eval, both absolute scores and model ranking can fluctuate widely depending on eval implementation. This means that model metrics aren‚Äôt truly comparable‚Äîeven for the same eval‚Äîunless the eval‚Äôs implementation is identical down to minute details like prompts and tokenization. Similarly, the author of QLoRA found MMLU overly sensitive and concluded: ‚Äúdo not work with/report or trust MMLU scores‚Äù.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond conventional evals such as those mentioned above, an emerging trend is to use a strong LLM as a reference-free metric to evaluate generations from other LLMs. This means we may not need human judgments or gold references for evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "G-Eval is a framework that applies LLMs with Chain-of-Though (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm to evaluate LLM outputs. First, they provide a task introduction and evaluation criteria to an LLM and ask it to generate a CoT of evaluation steps. Then, to evaluate coherence in news summarization, they concatenate the prompt, CoT, news article, and summary and ask the LLM to output a score between 1 to 5. Finally, they use the probabilities of the output tokens from the LLM to normalize the score and take their weighted summation as the final result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview of G-Eval (source)\n",
      "\n",
      "They found that GPT-4 as an evaluator had a high Spearman correlation with human judgments (0.514), outperforming all previous methods. It also outperformed traditional metrics on aspects such as coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance. On topical chat, it did better than traditional metrics such as ROUGE-L, BLEU-4, and BERTScore across several criteria such as naturalness, coherence, engagingness, and groundedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vicuna paper adopted a similar approach. They start by defining eight categories (writing, roleplay, extraction, reasoning, math, coding, STEM, and humanities/social science) before developing 10 questions for each category. Next, they generated answers from five chatbots: LLaMA, Alpaca, ChatGPT, Bard, and Vicuna. Finally, they asked GPT-4 to rate the quality of the answers based on helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, they found that GPT-4 not only provided consistent scores but could also give detailed explanations for those scores. Under the single answer grading paradigm, GPT-4 had higher agreement with humans (85%) than the humans had amongst themselves (81%). This suggests that GPT-4‚Äôs judgment aligns closely with the human evaluators.\n",
      "\n",
      "QLoRA also used an LLM to evaluate another LLM‚Äôs output. They asked GPT-4 to rate the performance of various models against gpt-3.5-turbo on the Vicuna benchmark. Given the responses from gpt-3.5-turbo and another model, GPT-4 was prompted to score both out of 10 and explain its ratings. They also measured performance via direct comparisons between models, simplifying the task to a three-class rating scheme that included ties.\n",
      "\n",
      "To validate the automated evaluation, they collected human judgments on the Vicuna benchmark. Using Mechanical Turk, they enlisted two annotators for comparisons to gpt-3.5-turbo, and three annotators for pairwise comparisons. They found that human and GPT-4 ranking of models were largely in agreement, with a Spearman rank correlation of 0.55 at the model level. This provides an additional data point suggesting that LLM-based automated evals could be a cost-effective and reasonable alternative to human evals.\n",

      "How to apply evals?\n",
      "\n",
      "Building solid evals should be the starting point for any LLM-based system or product (as well as conventional machine learning systems).\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, classical metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE don‚Äôt make sense for more complex tasks such as abstractive summarization or dialogue. Furthermore, we‚Äôve seen that benchmarks like MMLU (and metrics like ROUGE) are sensitive to how they‚Äôre implemented and measured. And to be candid, unless your LLM system is studying for a school exam, using MMLU as an eval doesn‚Äôt quite make sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, instead of using off-the-shelf benchmarks, we can start by collecting a set of task-specific evals (i.e., prompt, context, expected outputs as references). These evals will then guide prompt engineering, model selection, fine-tuning, and so on. And as we update our systems, we can run these evals to quickly measure improvements or regressions. Think of it as Eval Driven Development (EDD).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the evaluation dataset, we also need useful metrics. They help us distill performance changes into a single number that‚Äôs comparable across eval runs. And if we can simplify the problem, we can choose metrics that are easier to compute and interpret.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest task is probably classification: If we‚Äôre using an LLM for classification-like tasks (e.g., toxicity detection, document categorization) or extractive QA without dialogue, we can rely on standard classification metrics such as recall, precision, PRAUC, etc. If our task has no correct answer but we have references (e.g., machine translation, extractive summarization), we can rely on reference metrics based on matching (BLEU, ROUGE) or semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, these metrics may not work for more open-ended tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue, and others. But collecting human judgments can be slow and expensive. Thus, we may opt to lean on automated evaluations via a strong LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relative to human judgments which are typically noisy (due to differing biases among annotators), LLM judgments tend to be less noisy (as the bias is more systematic) but more biased. Nonetheless, since we‚Äôre aware of these biases, we can mitigate them accordingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "Position bias: LLMs tend to favor the response in the first position. To mitigate this, we can evaluate the same pair of responses twice while swapping their order. If the same response is preferred in both orders, we mark it as a win; else, it‚Äôs a tie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verbosity bias: LLMs tend to favor longer, wordier responses over more concise ones, even if the latter is clearer and of higher quality. A possible solution is to ensure that comparison responses are similar in length.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-enhancement bias: LLMs have a slight bias towards their own answers. GPT-4 favors itself with a 10% higher win rate while Claude-v1 favors itself with a 25% higher win rate. To counter this, don‚Äôt use the same LLM for evaluation tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another tip: Rather than asking an LLM for a direct evaluation (via giving a score), try giving it a reference and asking for a comparison. This helps with reducing noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, sometimes the best eval is human eval aka vibe check. (Not to be confused with the poorly named code evaluation benchmark HumanEval.) As mentioned in the Latent Space podcast with MosaicML (34th minute):\n",
      "\n",
      "The vibe-based eval cannot be underrated. ‚Ä¶ One of our evals was just having a bunch of prompts and watching the answers as the models trained and see if they change. Honestly, I don‚Äôt really believe that any of these eval metrics capture what we care about. One of our prompts was ‚Äúsuggest games for a 3-year-old and a 7-year-old to play‚Äù and that was a lot more valuable to see how the answer changed during the course of training. ‚Äî Jonathan Frankle\n",

      "RAG helps reduce hallucination by grounding the model on the retrieved context, thus increasing factuality. In addition, it‚Äôs cheaper to keep retrieval indices up-to-date than to continuously pre-train an LLM. This cost efficiency makes it easier to provide LLMs with access to recent data via RAG. Finally, if we need to update or remove data such as biased or toxic documents, it‚Äôs more straightforward to update the retrieval index (compared to fine-tuning or prompting an LLM not to generate toxic outputs).\n",

It‚Äôs usually learned from a corpus of text such as Wikipedia. Think of them as a universal encoding for text, where similar items are close to each other while dissimilar items are farther apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good embedding is one that does well on a downstream task, such as retrieving similar items. Huggingface‚Äôs Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) scores various models on diverse tasks such as classification, clustering, retrieval, summarization, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick note: While we mainly discuss text embeddings here, embeddings can take many modalities. For example, CLIP is multimodal and embeds images and text in the same space, allowing us to find images most similar to an input text. We can also embed products based on user behavior (e.g., clicks, purchases) or graph relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAG has its roots in open-domain Q&A. An early Meta paper showed that retrieving relevant documents via TF-IDF and providing them as context to a language model (BERT) improved performance on an open-domain QA task. They converted each task into a cloze statement and queried the language model for the missing token.\n",

      "Following that, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) showed that using dense embeddings (instead of a sparse vector space such as TF-IDF) for document retrieval can outperform strong baselines like Lucene BM25 (65.2% vs. 42.9% for top-5 accuracy.) They also showed that higher retrieval precision translates to higher end-to-end QA accuracy, highlighting the importance of upstream retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "To learn the DPR embedding, they fine-tuned two independent BERT-based encoders on existing question-answer pairs. The passage encoder (\\(E_p\\)) embeds text passages into vectors while the query encoder (\\(E_q\\)) embeds questions into vectors. The query embedding is then used to retrieve \\(k\\) passages that are most similar to the question.\n",

      "They trained the encoders so that the dot-product similarity makes a good ranking function, and optimized the loss function as the negative log-likelihood of the positive passage.

The goal is to learn a vector space such that pairs of questions and their relevant passages are close together.\n",
      "\n",
      "For inference, they embed all passages (via \\(E_p\\)) and index them in FAISS offline. Then, given a question at query time, they compute the question embedding (via \\(E_q\\)), retrieve the top \\(k\\) passages via approximate nearest neighbors, and provide it to the language model (BERT) that outputs the answer to the question.\n",

      "To address these downsides, they introduced RAG (aka semi-parametric models). Dense vector retrieval serves as the non-parametric component while a pre-trained LLM acts as the parametric component.

For generation, they proposed two approaches that vary in how the retrieved passages are used to generate output.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document to generate the complete sequence. Thus, for \\(k\\) retrieved documents, the generator produces an output for each document. Then, the probability of each output sequence is marginalized (sum the probability of each output sequence in \\(k\\) and weigh it by the probability of each document being retrieved). Finally, the output sequence with the highest probability is selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, RAG-Token can generate each token based on a different document. Given \\(k\\) retrieved documents, the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document before marginalizing (aggregating all the individual token distributions.). The process is then repeated for the next token. This means that, for each token generation, it can retrieve a different set of \\(k\\) relevant documents based on the original input and previously generated tokens. Thus, documents can have different retrieval probabilities and contribute differently to the next generated token.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) also uses retrieval with generative models for open-domain QA. It supports two methods for retrieval, BM25 (Lucene with default parameters) and DPR. FiD is named for how it performs fusion on the retrieved documents in the decoder only.\n",

      "\n",
      "Because it processes passages independently in the encoder, it can scale to a large number of passages as it only needs to do self-attention over one context at a time.

Then, during decoding, the decoder processes the encoded passages jointly, allowing it to better aggregate context across multiple retrieved passages.\n",

What‚Äôs different is that RETRO does retrieval throughout the entire pre-training stage, and not just during inference. Furthermore, they fetch relevant documents based on chunks of the input. This allows for finer-grained, repeated retrieval during generation instead of only retrieving once per query.\n",

      "For each input chunk (\\(C_u\\)), the \\(k\\) retrieved chunks \\(RET(C_u)\\) are fed into an encoder.

      "\n",
      "The next step is to define evaluation metrics. We‚Äôve discussed this in a previous section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, select a pre-trained model. There are several open LLMs with permissive licenses to choose from. Excluding Llama 2 (since it isn‚Äôt fully commercial use), Falcon-40B is known to be the best-performing model. Nonetheless, I‚Äôve found it unwieldy to fine-tune and serve in production given how heavy it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, I‚Äôm inclined to use smaller models like the Falcon-7B. And if we can simplify and frame the task more narrowly, BERT (340M params), RoBERTA (355M params), and BART (406M params) are solid picks for classification and natural language inference tasks. Beyond that, Flan-T5 (770M and 3B variants) is a reliable baseline for translation, abstractive summarization, headline generation, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may also need to update the model architecture, such as when the pre-trained model‚Äôs architecture doesn‚Äôt align with the task. For example, we might need to update the classification heads on BERT or T5 to match our task. Tip: If the task is a simple binary classification task, NLI models can work out of the box. Entailment is mapped to positive, contradiction is mapped to negative, while the neural label can indicate uncertainty.\n",

      "Caching is a technique to store data that has been previously retrieved or computed. This way, future requests for the same data can be served faster. In the space of serving LLM generations, the popularized approach is to cache the LLM response keyed on the embedding of the input request. Then, for each new request, if a semantically similar request is received, we can serve the cached response.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some practitioners, this sounds like ‚Äúa disaster waiting to happen.‚Äù I‚Äôm inclined to agree. Thus, I think the key to adopting this pattern is figuring out how to cache safely, instead of solely depending on semantic similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why caching?\n",
      "\n",
      "Caching can significantly reduce latency for responses that have been served before. In addition, by eliminating the need to compute a response for the same input again and again, we can reduce the number of LLM requests and thus save cost. Also, there are certain use cases that do not support latency on the order of seconds. Thus, pre-computing and caching may be the only way to serve those use cases.\n",

Overall, caching enables efficient reuse of previously fetched or computed data. (More about caching and best practices.)\n",

      "\n",
      "Cache storage: If the request is similar, the cached response is fetched and served.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLM: If the request isn‚Äôt similar enough, it gets passed to the LLM which then generates the result. Finally, the response is served and cached for future use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Redis also shared a similar example, mentioning that some teams go as far as precomputing all the queries they anticipate receiving. Then, they set a similarity threshold on which queries are similar enough to warrant a cached response.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to apply caching?\n",
      "\n",
      "We should start with having a good understanding of user request patterns. This allows us to design the cache thoughtfully so it can be applied reliably.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let‚Äôs consider a non-LLM example. Imagine we‚Äôre caching product prices for an e-commerce site. During checkout, is it safe to display the (possibly outdated) cached price? Probably not, since the price the customer sees during checkout should be the same as the final amount they‚Äôre charged. Caching isn‚Äôt appropriate here as we need to ensure consistency for the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, bringing it back to LLM responses. Imagine we get a request for a summary of ‚ÄúMission Impossible 2‚Äù that‚Äôs semantically similar enough to ‚ÄúMission Impossible 3‚Äù. If we‚Äôre looking up cache based on semantic similarity, we could serve the wrong response.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to consider if caching is effective for the usage pattern. One way to quantify this is via the cache hit rate (percentage of requests served directly from the cache). If the usage pattern is uniformly random, the cache would need frequent updates. Thus, the effort to keep the cache up-to-date could negate any benefit a cache has to offer. On the other hand, if the usage follows a power law where a small proportion of unique requests account for the majority of traffic (e.g., search queries, product views), then caching could be an effective strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond semantic similarity, we could also explore caching based on:\n",
      "\n",
      "Item IDs: This applies when we pre-compute summaries of product reviews or generate a summary for an entire movie trilogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pairs of Item IDs: Such as when we generate comparisons between two movies. While this appears to be \\(O(N^2)\\), in practice, a small number of combinations drive the bulk of traffic, such as comparison between popular movies in a series or genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constrained input: Such as variables like movie genre, director, or lead actor. For example, if a user is looking for movies by a specific director, we could execute a structured query and run it through an LLM to frame the response more eloquently. Another example is generating code based on drop-down options‚Äîif the code has been verified to work, we can cache it for reliable reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, caching doesn‚Äôt only have to occur on-the-fly. As Redis shared, we can pre-compute LLM generations offline or asynchronously before serving them. By serving from a cache, we shift the latency from generation (typically seconds) to cache lookup (milliseconds). Pre-computing in batch can also help reduce cost relative to serving in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the approaches listed here may not be as flexible as semantically caching on natural language inputs, I think it provides a good balance between efficiency and reliability.\n",

      "Guardrails: To ensure output quality\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of LLMs, guardrails validate the output of LLMs, ensuring that the output doesn‚Äôt just sound good but is also syntactically correct, factual, and free from harmful content. It also includes guarding against adversarial input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why guardrails?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, they help ensure that model outputs are reliable and consistent enough to use in production. For example, we may require output to be in a specific JSON schema so that it‚Äôs machine-readable, or we need code generated to be executable. Guardrails can help with such syntactic validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, they provide an additional layer of safety and maintain quality control over an LLM‚Äôs output. For example, to verify if the content generated is appropriate for serving, we may want to check that the output isn‚Äôt harmful, verify it for factual accuracy, or ensure coherence with the context provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "More about guardrails\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach is to control the model‚Äôs responses via prompts.

      "\n",
      "Example of HHH prompt (source)\n",
      "\n",
      "A more common approach is to validate the output. An example is the Guardrails package. It allows users to add structural, type, and quality requirements on LLM outputs via Pydantic-style validation. And if the check fails, it can trigger corrective action such as filtering on the offending output or regenerating another response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the validation logic is in validators.py. It‚Äôs interesting to see how they‚Äôre implemented. Broadly speaking, its validators fall into the following categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "Single output value validation: This includes ensuring that the output (i) is one of the predefined choices, (ii) has a length within a certain range, (iii) if numeric, falls within an expected range, and (iv) is a complete sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntactic checks: This includes ensuring that generated URLs are valid and reachable, and that Python and SQL code is bug-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Semantic checks: This verifies that the output is aligned with the reference document, or that the extractive summary closely matches the source document. These checks can be done via cosine similarity or fuzzy matching techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety checks: This ensures that the generated output is free of inappropriate language or that the quality of translated text is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia‚Äôs NeMo-Guardrails follows a similar principle but is designed to guide LLM-based conversational systems. Rather than focusing on syntactic guardrails, it emphasizes semantic ones. This includes ensuring that the assistant steers clear of politically charged topics, provides factually correct information, and can detect jailbreaking attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, NeMo‚Äôs approach is somewhat different: Instead of using more deterministic checks like verifying if a value exists in a list or inspecting code for syntax errors, NeMo leans heavily on using another LLM to validate outputs (inspired by SelfCheckGPT).\n",
      "\n",
      "In their example for fact-checking and preventing hallucination, they ask the LLM itself to check whether the most recent output is consistent with the given context. To fact-check, the LLM is queried if the response is true based on the documents retrieved from the knowledge base. To prevent hallucinations, since there isn‚Äôt a knowledge base available, they get the LLM to generate multiple alternative completions which serve as the context. The underlying assumption is that if the LLM produces multiple completions that disagree with one another, the original completion is likely a hallucination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moderation example follows a similar approach: The response is screened for harmful and unethical content via an LLM. Given the nuance of ethics and harmful content, heuristics and conventional machine learning techniques fall short. Thus, an LLM is required for a deeper understanding of the intent and structure of dialogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from using guardrails to verify the output of LLMs, we can also directly steer the output to adhere to a specific grammar. An example of this is Microsoft‚Äôs Guidance. Unlike Guardrails which imposes JSON schema via a prompt, Guidance enforces the schema by injecting tokens that make up the structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can think of Guidance as a domain-specific language for LLM interactions and output. It draws inspiration from Handlebars, a popular templating language used in web applications that empowers users to perform variable interpolation and logical control.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Guidance sets itself apart from regular templating languages by executing linearly. This means it maintains the order of tokens generated. Thus, by inserting tokens that are part of the structure‚Äîinstead of relying on the LLM to generate them correctly‚ÄîGuidance can dictate the specific output format. In their examples, they show how to generate JSON that‚Äôs always valid, generate complex output formats with multiple keys, ensure that LLMs play the right roles, and have agents interact with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also introduced a concept called token healing, a useful feature that helps avoid subtle bugs that occur due to tokenization. In simple terms, it rewinds the generation by one token before the end of the prompt and then restricts the first generated token to have a prefix matching the last token in the prompt. This eliminates the need to fret about token boundaries when crafting prompts.\n",

      "\n",
      "Content safety guardrails: These verify that the output has no harmful or inappropriate content. It can be as simple as checking against the List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words or using profanity detection models. (It‚Äôs common to run moderation classifiers on output.) More complex and nuanced output can rely on an LLM evaluator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Semantic/factuality guardrails: These confirm that the output is semantically relevant to the input. Say we‚Äôre generating a two-sentence summary of a movie based on its synopsis.

This section guides the design for how AI products request and process user data and interactions. Outputs focus on mistakes, multiple options, confidence, attribution, and limitations. The intent is to ensure the model‚Äôs output is presented in a comprehensible and useful manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The differences between the three guidelines are insightful. Google has more emphasis on considerations for training data and model development, likely due to its engineering-driven culture. Microsoft has more focus on mental models, likely an artifact of the HCI academic study. Lastly, Apple‚Äôs approach centers around providing a seamless UX, a focus likely influenced by its cultural values and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to apply defensive UX?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some patterns based on the guidelines above. (Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not a designer.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Set the right expectations. This principle is consistent across all three guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft: Make clear how well the system can do what it can do (help the user understand how often the AI system may make mistakes)\n",
      "\n",
      "Google: Set the right expectations (be transparent with your users about what your AI-powered product can and cannot do)\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple: Help people establish realistic expectations (describe the limitation in marketing material or within the feature‚Äôs context)\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be as simple as adding a brief disclaimer above AI-generated results, like those of Bard, or highlighting our app‚Äôs limitations on its landing page, like how ChatGPT does it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example of a disclaimer on Google Bard results (Note: nrows is not a valid argument.)\n",
      "\n",
      "By being transparent about our product‚Äôs capabilities and limitations, we help users calibrate their expectations about its functionality and output. While this may cause users to trust it less in the short run, it helps foster trust in the long run‚Äîusers are less likely to overestimate our product and subsequently face disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enable efficient dismissal. This is explicitly mentioned as Microsoft‚Äôs Guideline 8: Support efficient dismissal (make it easy to dismiss or ignore undesired AI system services).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a user is navigating our site and a chatbot pops up asking if they need help, it should be easy for the user to dismiss the chatbot. This ensures the chatbot doesn‚Äôt get in the way, especially on devices with smaller screens. Similarly, GitHub Copilot allows users to conveniently ignore its code suggestions by simply continuing to type. While this may reduce usage of the AI feature in the short term, it prevents it from becoming a nuisance and potentially reducing customer satisfaction in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide attribution. This is listed in all three guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft: Make clear why the system did what it did (enable the user to access an explanation of why the AI system behaved as it did)\n",
      "\n",
      "Google: Add context from human sources (help users appraise your recommendations with input from 3rd-party sources)\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple: Consider using attributions to help people distinguish among results\n",
      "\n",
      "Citations are becoming an increasingly common design element. Take BingChat for example. When we make a query, it includes citations, usually from reputable sources, in its responses. This not only shows where the information came from, but also allows users to assess the quality of the sources. Similarly, imagine we‚Äôre using an LLM to explain why a user might like a product. Alongside the LLM-generated explanation, we could include a quote from an actual review or mention the product rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context from experts and the community also enhances user trust. For example, if a user is seeking recommendations for a hiking trail, mentioning that a suggested trail comes highly recommended by the relevant community can go a long way. It not only adds value to the recommendation but also helps users calibrate trust through the human connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example of attribution via social proof (source)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Apple‚Äôs guidelines include popular attributions such as ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôve read non-fiction‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew books by authors you‚Äôve read‚Äù. These descriptors not only personalize the experience but also provide context, enhancing user understanding and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anchor on familiarity. When introducing users to a new AI product or feature, it helps to guide them with familiar UX patterns and features. This makes it easier for users to focus on the main task and start to earn customer trust in our new product. Resist the temptation to showcase new and ‚Äúmagical‚Äù features via exotic UI elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along a similar vein, chat-based features are becoming more common due to ChatGPT‚Äôs growing popularity. For example, chat with your docs, chat to query your data, chat to buy groceries. However, I question whether chat is the right UX for most user experiences‚Äîit just takes too much effort relative to the familiar UX of clicking on text and images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, increasing user effort leads to higher expectations that are harder to meet. Netflix shared that users have higher expectations for recommendations that result from explicit actions such as search. In general, the more effort a user puts in (e.g., chat, search), the higher the expectations they have. Contrast this with lower-effort interactions such as scrolling over recommendations slates or clicking on a product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, while chat offers more flexibility, it also demands more user effort. Moreover, using a chat box is less intuitive as it lacks signifiers on how users can adjust the output. Overall, I think that sticking with a familiar and constrained UI makes it easier for users to navigate our product; chat should only be considered as a secondary or tertiary option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collect user feedback: To build our data flywheel\n",
      "\n",
      "Gathering user feedback allows us to learn their preferences. Specific to LLM products, user feedback contributes to building evals, fine-tuning, and guardrails. If we think about it, data‚Äîsuch as corpus for pre-training, expert-crafted demonstrations, human preferences for reward modeling‚Äîis one of the few moats for LLM products. Thus, we want to be deliberately thinking about collecting user feedback when designing our UX.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback can be explicit or implicit. Explicit feedback is information users provide in response to a request by our product; implicit feedback is information we learn from user interactions without needing users to deliberately provide feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why collect user feedback\n",
      "\n",
      "User feedback helps our models improve. By learning what users like, dislike, or complain about, we can improve our models to better meet their needs. It also allows us to adapt to individual preferences. Recommendation systems are a prime example. As users interact with items, we learn what they like and dislike and better cater to their tastes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the feedback loop helps us evaluate our system‚Äôs overall performance. While evals can help us measure model/system performance, user feedback offers a concrete measure of user satisfaction and product effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to collect user feedback\n",
      "\n",
      "Make it easy for users to provide feedback. This is echoed across all three guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft: Encourage granular feedback (enable the user to provide feedback indicating their preferences during regular interaction with the AI system)\n",
      "\n",
      "Google: Let users give feedback (give users the opportunity for real-time teaching, feedback, and error correction)\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple: Provide actionable information your app can use to improve the content and experience it presents to people\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT is one such example. Users can indicate thumbs up/down on responses, or choose to regenerate a response if it‚Äôs really bad or unhelpful. This is useful feedback on human preferences which can then be used to fine-tune LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midjourney is another good example. After images are generated, users can generate a new set of images (negative feedback), tweak an image by asking for a variation (positive feedback), or upscale and download the image (strong positive feedback). This enables Midjourney to gather rich comparison data on the outputs generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example of collecting user feedback as part of the UX\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider implicit feedback too. Implicit feedback is information that arises as users interact with our product. Unlike the specific responses we get from explicit feedback, implicit feedback can provide a wide range of data on user behavior and preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copilot-like assistants are a prime example. Users indicate whether a suggestion was helpful by either wholly accepting it (strong positive feedback), accepting and making minor tweaks (positive feedback), or ignoring it (neutral/negative feedback). Alternatively, they may update the comment that led to the generated code, suggesting that the initial code generation didn‚Äôt meet their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chatbots, such as ChatGPT and BingChat, are another example. How has daily usage changed over time? If the product is sticky, it suggests that users like it. Also, how long is the average conversation? This can be tricky to interpret: Is a longer conversation better because the conversation was engaging and fruitful? Or is it worse because it took the user longer to get what they needed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Other patterns common in machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the seven patterns above, there are other patterns in machine learning that are also relevant to LLM systems and products. They include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Data flywheel: Continuous data collection improves the model and leads to a better user experience. This, in turn, promotes more usage which provides more data to further evaluate and fine-tune models, creating a virtuous cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cascade: Rather than assigning a single, complex task to the LLM, we can simplify and break it down so it only has to handle tasks it excels at, such as reasoning or communicating eloquently. RAG is an example of this. Instead of relying on the LLM to retrieve and rank items based on its internal knowledge, we can augment LLMs with external knowledge and focus on applying the LLM‚Äôs reasoning abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitoring: This helps demonstrate the value added by the AI system, or the lack of it. Someone shared an anecdote of running an LLM-based customer support solution in prod for two weeks before discontinuing it‚Äîan A/B test showed that losses were 12x more when using an LLM as a substitute for their support team!\n",
      "\n",
      "(Read more about design patterns for machine learning code and systems.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, here‚Äôs what others said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Separation of concerns/task decomposition- having distinct prompts for distinct subtasks and chaining them together helps w attention and reliability (hurts latency). We were having trouble specifying a rigid output structure AND variable response content so we split up the tasks ‚Äî Erick Enriquez\n",
      "\n",
      "A few others that will be needed:\n",
      "role based access control: who can access what;\n",
      "security: if I‚Äôm using a DB with an LLM, how do I ensure that I have the right security guards ‚Äî Krishna\n",

      "Consistent output format: setting outputs to a standardized format such as JSON;\n",
      "Tool augmentation: offload tasks to more specialised, proven, reliable models ‚Äî Paul Tune\n",
      "\n",
      "Security: mitigate cache poisoning, input validation, mitigate prompt injection, training data provenance, output with non-vulnerable code, mitigate malicious input aimed at influencing requests used by tools (AI Agent), mitigate denial of service (stress test llm), to name a few :) ‚Äî Anderson Darario\n",
      "\n",
      "Another ux/ui related: incentivize users to provide feedback on generated answers (implicit or explicit). Implicit could be sth like copilot‚Äôs ghost text style, if accepted with TAB, meaning positive feedback etc. ‚Äî Wen Yang\n",
      "\n",
      "Great list. I would add consistency checks like self-consistency sampling, chaining and decomposition of tasks, and the emsembling of multiple model outputs. Applying each of these almost daily. Dan White\n",

Each uses a different method to predict probabilities and select answers. The Original MMLU focuses on the answers only, HELM uses the next token probabilities from the model, and EleutherAI computes the probability of the full answer sequence. The author notes that these differences can cause fluctuations in absolute scores and model ranking, making model metrics incomparable unless the evaluation's implementation is identical.

       "**`Final Response:`** There are metrics used to evaluate text generation quality, which can be grouped into two categories: context-dependent and context-free. Context-dependent metrics consider the context and are task-specific, requiring adjustments for different tasks. On the other hand, context-free metrics do not consider context and are task-agnostic, making them easier to apply across various tasks.\n",

       "Some commonly used metrics for evaluating text generation quality include BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and MoverScore. BLEU is a precision-based metric that counts the number of overlapping n-grams between the generated output and the reference, then divides it by the total number of words in the output. It is widely used in machine translation due to its cost-effectiveness.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, these conventional metrics have downsides. Firstly, there is often a poor correlation between these metrics and human judgments. Metrics like BLEU and ROUGE have shown negative correlation with human evaluations of fluency and moderate to low correlation with human adequacy scores, especially in tasks requiring creativity and diversity. Secondly, these metrics may not be adaptable to a wide range of tasks. For instance, metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which rely on n-gram overlap, are not suitable for tasks like abstractive summarization or dialogue where diverse responses are possible. Lastly, these metrics can have poor reproducibility, with high variance reported across different studies possibly due to variations in human judgment collection or metric parameter settings."
