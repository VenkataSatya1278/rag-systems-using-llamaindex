    "# Multi Document Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows building Multi Document Agents by combining recursive retrieval and \"document agents\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two motivating factors that lead to solutions for better retrieval:\n",
    "- Decoupling retrieval embeddings from chunk-based synthesis. Oftentimes fetching documents by their summaries will return more relevant context to queries rather than raw chunks. This is something that recursive retrieval directly allows.\n",
    "- Within a document, users may need to dynamically perform tasks beyond fact-based question-answering. We introduce the concept of \"document agents\" - agents that have access to both vector search and summary tools for a given document."
