The deep sea covers >63% of Earth\u2019s surface (Costello and Cheung, 2010) and is exposed \nto climate-driven changes in abyssal, intermediate and surface waters that influence sinking fluxes of particulate organic matter (high \nconfidence) (see Figure\u00a0Box\u00a03.3.1; Sections\u00a03.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.4.3.4; WGII AR5 Section\u00a030.5.7; SROCC Sections\u00a05.2.3, 5.2.4; Hoegh-Guldberg \net\u00a0al., 2014; Bindoff et\u00a0al., 2019a). These ecosystems are also influenced by non-climate drivers, especially fisheries, oil and gas extraction \n(Thurber et\u00a0al., 2014; Cordes et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019a); cable laying (United Nations, 2021); and mineral resource exploration (Hein \net\u00a0al., 2021); with proposed large-scale deep-sea mining a potential future source of impacts (Danovaro, 2018; Levin et\u00a0al., 2020).\nOcean warming alters biological processes in deep-sea ecosystems in ways that affect deep-sea habitat, biodiversity and material \nprocessing. Enhancement of microbial respiration by warming attenuates sinking POC, which has been associated with the globally \nprojected declines in total seafloor biomass of \u22129.8 and \u221213.0% by 2081\u20132100 relative to 1995\u20132014 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, \nrespectively (limited evidence) (Section\u00a0 3.4.3.4). Additionally, climate-change-driven oxygen loss (Section\u00a0 3.2.3.2; Luna et\u00a0 al., 2012; \nBelley et\u00a0al., 2016) and geographic shifts in predator distributions (Section\u00a03.4.3.1) are anticipated to affect deep-sea biodiversity (limited \nevidence, high agreement) (Smith et\u00a0al., 2012; Morato et\u00a0al., 2020). Complex responses of some bathyal crustacean assemblages to \nenvironmental change suggest an increase in phylogenetic diversity but limited decreases in abundances with temperature (Ashford \net\u00a0al., 2019). Acute mortality of some reef-forming cold-water corals to laboratory-simulated warming (Lunden et\u00a0al., 2014) suggests \nthat both long-term warming and the increase of MHWs in intermediate and deep waters (Elzahaby and Schaeffer, 2019) could pose \nsignificant risk to associated ecosystems (high confidence). Thermal tolerance thresholds (lethal and sub-lethal) of scleractinians in \nlaboratory settings depend on their geographic position and capacity for thermal adaptation, as well as other factors including food, \noxygen and pH (medium to high confidence) (Naumann et\u00a0al., 2013; Hennige et\u00a0al., 2014; Lunden et\u00a0al., 2014; Naumann et\u00a0al., 2014; \nGeorgian et\u00a0al., 2016; Gori et\u00a0al., 2016; Maier et\u00a0al., 2016; B\u00fcscher et\u00a0al., 2017).\nThe extension and intensification of deep-water acidification (Section\u00a03.2.3.1) has been identified as a further key risk to deep-water coral \necosystems (medium confidence) (Bindoff et\u00a0al., 2019a).

            "reference_answer": "Ocean warming impacts deep-sea ecosystems by altering biological processes that affect habitat, biodiversity, and material processing. Specifically, warming enhances microbial respiration, which reduces the sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC). This reduction is linked to projected global declines in total seafloor biomass. By 2081\u20132100, seafloor biomass is expected to decrease by 9.8% under the SSP1-2.6 scenario and by 13.0% under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, relative to the period 1995\u20132014. Additionally, ocean warming, along with climate-change-driven oxygen loss and shifts in predator distributions, is anticipated to affect deep-sea biodiversity. These changes could lead to complex responses in some species, such as bathyal crustaceans, which may experience increased phylogenetic diversity but limited decreases in abundance with rising temperatures.",

            "reference_answer": "Deep-water acidification poses significant risks to deep-water coral ecosystems, as highlighted in the context. The extension and intensification of acidification in deep waters is identified as a key risk, with medium confidence. This is because acidification can affect the structural integrity and survival of coral species that rely on calcium carbonate, such as scleractinians and gorgonians.\n\nSince the SROCC report, literature has continued to support the assessment that deep-water acidification is a critical threat to these ecosystems. Studies by Morato et al. (2020) and Puerta et al. (2020) reinforce the understanding of acidification's impacts on deep-water corals. Despite these risks, scleractinians and gorgonians have been found in regions that are undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate. This suggests that these corals may have some resilience or adaptation mechanisms that allow them to survive in less than ideal conditions, although the long-term effects of continued acidification remain a concern.",
