Several alternatives to \nblockchain that provide b etter performance have emerged, offering organizations \noptions to reduce costs, simplify development and reduce integration challenges while \nstill able to enjoy some of the core benefits of blockchains.  \nAlternative Distributed Ledgers . A simplified distributed ledger, without the com-\nplexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative \nfor trusted decentralized applications. Several options are available, including Hash-\ngraph, Iota Tangle and R3 Corda. \nIota and Hashgraph use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative data \nstructure for maint aining the ledger \uff0c while DAG approach allows an ap plication to \nwrite data quickly, and requires permission to conduct certain operations  that could \nslow down the transaction . The applications need to be configured to notify users \nwhen conflicts occur, and built-in rules rules to help resolve. \nAn Iota Tangle stores data across a DAG where each node, or vertex, represents a \ntransaction. The network grows via transactions rather than through a compute -\nintensive mining process. Iota supports micropayments and transactions across IoT \ndevices. It is mostly decentralized, but it does require a coordinator node that oversees \nand confirms the addition of new transactions. \nHashgraph also eliminates the need  for mining to grow the ledger by utilizing its \n\u201cgossip about gossip \u201d protocol that network nodes use to share i nformation, come to \nconsensus (another key process in blockchain) and add new transactions to the DAG. \nAs new data is added, an audit trail is also appended to the distributed ledger.  \nCentralized ledgers. Amazon's Quantum Ledger Database simplifies the pr ocess of \nimplementing a shared database designed for ledger -like applications that provides a \ncryptographically verifiable audit trail without all the overhead of a distributed ledger \nor blockchain. It promises the  immutability and verifiability of blockchain  combined \nwith the ease and scalability of a traditional cloud service \u3002One thing worth noting is \nthat the blockchain could still be a better option with untrusted players. \nDistributed databases. Distributed databases offer ome combination of data replica-\ntion and duplication to ensure data consistency and integrity .

For example, Bitcoin can only process roughly 3 to 7 \ntransactions per second, with Ethereum about 15 to 20 transactions.  \nSuch poor performance and cumbersome  operations are  mainly d ue to the com-\nplexity with encrypted and distributed nature in blockchains.

But this is more of a busi-\nness problem, as it may introduce changes to the business processes and the interac-\ntion patterns that need to be properly addressed from the strategy perspectives. \nScalability. To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in-\ntroduced, as discussed before. For example, with the  Lightning Network  [32] of \nBitcoin, a second layer to the main blockchain network is added in order to facilitate \nfaster transactions . Plasma [33] of Et hereum has a parent -child structure, processes \nthe transactions in the child -chain, and records the results in the parent -chain. Shar-\nding [34] groups subsets of nodes into smaller networks or \u2018shards\u2019 that are responsi-\nble for the transactions specific to t heir shard. When offered in conjunction with the \nproof-of-stake consensus mechanism, such mechanisms have the potential to scale up \nthe application. \nAs summarized in Table 1, private blockchain offer much better scalability, as the \nnodes in the network are purposely designed and enabled to process transactions in an \nenvironment of trusted parties. Therefore, some hybrid chains effectively combining \npublic chains for certain transactions, while employing private chains for other types \nof transactions would provide the best combination. \nIn addition, in almost all known business applications, it is not required to have \neveryone on the eco-system to participate or contribute to establish and maintain the \nintegrity of the distributed ledger. Therefore, policies or even smart contracts could be \nutilized to restrict participants. \nTechnically, workloads can be distributed intelligently to reduce processing needs \nfor more \u201ccritical\u201d (either business or technical) nodes.  \nInteroperability and Sta ndardization. Another m ain challenge is the lack of in-\nteroperability among the large number of blockchain networks. Over 6,500 projects \nadopted a variety of blockchain platforms and solutions with different protocols, pro-\ngramming languages, consensus mechanisms, and privacy meas ures, while most of \nthose blockchains work in silos and do not communicate with other peer networks. \nThe lack of universal standards and uniformity across blockchain protocols further \ncolluded the situation. \nVarious projects have initiated to address this problem. Ark uses SmartBridges [35] \narchitecture to bridge the gap of comm unication between the networks and it claims \nto offer unive rsal, cross-blockchain transmission and transfer with global interopera-\nbility. Cosmos [36] uses the Interblockchain Communi cation (IBC) protocol [37] to \nenable blockchain economies to operate outside silos, and trans fer files between each \nother. \nThe lack of standardization also impacts interoperability and eventually lead to in-\ncreased costs that  make mass adoption difficult. Therefore it is vital to establish  in-\ndustry-wide standards and protocols to help enterprises collaborate on application", "21 \n \nthe original Bitcoin and Ethereaum by 2 -4 orders of magnitude, from single digits to \nover 60000 TPSs.  \n4.2 Some Key Issues to be Further Investigated and Enhanced  \nData Structures  and Algorithms . From the original block structure to Merkel tree \nwith levels of hashed information, to DAG in Corda, it is evident that  significant im-\nprovements are still possible by innovating on underlying data structures that take ad-\nvantage of the representational characteristics of the transactions, especially their iden-\ntity information or business implications (\u201csmart ID\u201d[ 29]), business semantics [ 30], \ntemporal patterns [31], etc. With matching algorithms to enforce security and integrity, \nthey will definitely revolutionize the blockchain technology. In this regard, some self-\norganizing and potentially self-evolving structures\uff0c together with the help from artifi-\ncial intelligence and machine learning ( AI/ML), could be better fit while they could \nautomatically do only what\u2019s necessary and sufficient.  \nWith such innovative structures, algorithms can be further researched  that take ad-\nvantage of the full spectrum of analytical, stochastic and optimization, and of course \nAI/ML methods. Only in this way, the inefficiency of the cumbersome consensus and \nverification process prevailing in the current blockchain platforms can be  eventually \nsolved. \nData Models and Governance. As essentially \u201cevery company is a data company \u201d, \nblockchains potentially generate significant amount of new data to provide  the re-\nquired privacy and security , resilience and irreversibility. If bad data are offered cor-\nrectly or if the data store  contains false information but is offered right, they will all \nend up on the system.  \nAs some high impact incidences of data loss and breach were reported that could \ndiscourage companies from transitioning to blockchains, data governance has become \nmore critical. Poor execution of smart contracts could result in bad automated decision-\nmaking that could lead to tremendous business risks. Data privacy still remains as a \nchallenging issue while enterprise blockchain projects need to remedy. \nPerformance. As discussed earlier, the performance of a blockchain could be domi-\nnated by the least \u201cpowerful\u201d participating node in the network. So as Solana did, \nhow to effectively enforce some minimal standards on certain node capabilities, and \nfurther classify nodes into different groups with relevant rights and privileges without \nsacrificing the integrity assurance, could be appealing. It is even better if we can make \nsuch decisions adaptive to the business applications and workloads. \nIt is also feasible to off -load some heavy processing to a secondary support chain \nor system, while the main blockchain is only used to record the final result of the \ntransactions. For example, organizations always maintain some lists of \u201ctrusted\u201d or \n\u201ctrust-worthy\u201d clients, conducti ng transactions with those clients do not necessarily \nneed on-time completion of all the complex hashing operations for the entire distrib-\nuted ledger. Instead results from the off -loaded expensive operations only need to be \nreflected in the main chain, bas ed on the \u201ctrust -worthiness\u201d of the partners.

Some alternative approaches to achieve the secure and immutable nature of the \ndistributed ledger is also included. Section 5 conclude the paper with a few quick \nremarks.  \n2 Main Frameworks and Consensus Algorithms \nThis section will give a general description of blockchain architecture, in terms of \nhow blocks are structured and organized into a chain. Issues related to c onsensus, \nperformance, and scalability will be explored respectively. The reasons for choosing \nthese five platforms as examples, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, \nEOS and Solana, will be explained at the end of this section. \n2.1 General Description of Blockchain and Its Main Data Structure \nBlockchain is  a chain  linking or \u201c chaining\u201d different blocks , while a block is the \nfoundation and formed by recording and calculating all the transactions in a Merkle \ntree and adding the previous block header hash v alue(s) into the current header, as in \nFig. 1. \nversion\nmerkle \nroot hash \nvalue\nTimestamp nBits nonce\nprevious \nblock \nheader \nhash\nBlock Header\nTransaction (TX) Counter\nTX TX TX TX TX TX\n \nFig. 1. Block Structure \nThe hash value of the previous block will be included i n the current block h ash. \nFig. 2 shows how one block is connected to the other. Note that the first block only \nhas the hash value from its own transactions [2]."], "response": "The main body of each block in the blockchain network is structured as a Merkle Tree. In this structure, every transaction is individually hashed, and then these hash values are paired and hashed together. This process continues until a single hash value is obtained for the entire block. This ensures that the integrity of the transactions within the block is maintained and any tampering can be easily detected.\n\nDiagram:\nTX 1 TX 2 TX 3 TX 4\nHash(1) Hash(2) Hash(3) Hash(4)\nHash(1,2) Hash(3,4)\nHash(1,2,3,4)", "passing": true, "feedback": "YES", "score": 1.0, "pairwise_source": null, "invalid_result": false, "invalid_reason": null}, {"query": "Discuss the role and significance of smart contracts in a blockchain network.

But this is more of a busi-\nness problem, as it may introduce changes to the business processes and the interac-\ntion patterns that need to be properly addressed from the strategy perspectives. \nScalability. To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in-\ntroduced, as discussed before. For example, with the  Lightning Network  [32] of \nBitcoin, a second layer to the main blockchain network is added in order to facilitate \nfaster transactions . Plasma [33] of Et hereum has a parent -child structure, processes \nthe transactions in the child -chain, and records the results in the parent -chain. Shar-\nding [34] groups subsets of nodes into smaller networks or \u2018shards\u2019 that are responsi-\nble for the transactions specific to t heir shard. When offered in conjunction with the \nproof-of-stake consensus mechanism, such mechanisms have the potential to scale up \nthe application. \nAs summarized in Table 1, private blockchain offer much better scalability, as the \nnodes in the network are purposely designed and enabled to process transactions in an \nenvironment of trusted parties. Therefore, some hybrid chains effectively combining \npublic chains for certain transactions, while employing private chains for other types \nof transactions would provide the best combination. \nIn addition, in almost all known business applications, it is not required to have \neveryone on the eco-system to participate or contribute to establish and maintain the \nintegrity of the distributed ledger. Therefore, policies or even smart contracts could be \nutilized to restrict participants. \nTechnically, workloads can be distributed intelligently to reduce processing needs \nfor more \u201ccritical\u201d (either business or technical) nodes.  \nInteroperability and Sta ndardization. Another m ain challenge is the lack of in-\nteroperability among the large number of blockchain networks. Over 6,500 projects \nadopted a variety of blockchain platforms and solutions with different protocols, pro-\ngramming languages, consensus mechanisms, and privacy meas ures, while most of \nthose blockchains work in silos and do not communicate with other peer networks. \nThe lack of universal standards and uniformity across blockchain protocols further \ncolluded the situation. \nVarious projects have initiated to address this problem. Ark uses SmartBridges [35] \narchitecture to bridge the gap of comm unication between the networks and it claims \nto offer unive rsal, cross-blockchain transmission and transfer with global interopera-\nbility. Cosmos [36] uses the Interblockchain Communi cation (IBC) protocol [37] to \nenable blockchain economies to operate outside silos, and trans fer files between each \nother. \nThe lack of standardization also impacts interoperability and eventually lead to in-\ncreased costs that  make mass adoption difficult. Therefore it is vital to establish  in-\ndustry-wide standards and protocols to help enterprises collaborate on application", "5 \n \nTX Counter\nTX TX TX\nprevious block \nheader hash\nBlock \nheader\nTX Counter\nTX TX TX\nprevious block \nheader hash\nBlock \nheader\nTX Counter\nTX TX TX\nprevious block \nheader hash\nBlock \nheader\n............\n \nFig. 2.

Merkle Tree inside block body \nSmart contract. In blockchain network, the smart contract is \u201ca secure and unstoppa-\nble computer program representing an agreement that is automatically executable and  \nenforceable\u201d [ 3]. It materializes rules, definitions and expectations in the forms of \ncode and data, so that all nodes will act accordingly.  \nThe smart contract should be executed by all nodes in the network and the same re-\nsults can be obtained.  For instance, during transaction process, the smart contract \ninside nodes perform s calculations, store s information, publicize s state and do es \ntransferring. Every node has no choice but to obey these rules and get same results.  \nUnder such circumstances, a referee or a third party is not needed. Thus, the crisis of \ntrust inside the network is largely decreased.  \nWhen implementing smart contracts at  the enterprise l evel, a co -evolution of both \ncontract and technology is highly required. Enterprise smart contracts can provide a \nseries of service by modularizing data, contract participants and external dependen-\ncies [4]. These services can perfectly satisfy the requirem ents of privacy, scalability \nand internal administration.

By eliminating the need for a third party or referee, smart contracts significantly reduce the crisis of trust within the network. Every node must adhere to the rules specified in the smart contract, leading to consistent and transparent results across the network.\n\nEnterprise smart contracts offer a range of services by modularizing data, contract participants, and external dependencies. These contracts can address requirements related to privacy, scalability, and internal administration effectively. For example, enterprise smart contracts can facilitate services such as automated transactions, data storage, information sharing, and process automation. These services are enhanced by blockchain technology, enabling shared and cross-organizational environments that promote trust and efficiency in business operations.", "passing": true, "feedback": "YES", "score": 1.0, "pairwise_source": null, "invalid_result": false, "invalid_reason": null}, {"query": "What are the two core proof-based algorithms mentioned in the document and what issues do they bring to consensus algorithms?", "contexts": ["6 \n \nConsensus issues. The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed.", "13 \n \n EOS provides not only tools for DApps, but also solutions for scalability issues, \nwhich we will further discuss in Section 3.5.  EOS has the following three main fea-\ntures [19]:  \n1. Low latency. The platform supports low latency with DPoS mechanism. \n2. Parallel Performance. The off -load can allocated among multiple CPUs and \ncomputers in terms of large-scale applications. This avoid heavy on -chain \nworkload.  \n3. Sequential Performance. Due to some limitations in sequentially dependent \nsteps, those applications that cannot support parallel algorithms will be \nprovided with fast sequential processing for high volumes. \nBy deploying DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism  [20], this \npermissioned EOS blockchain has become suitable for not only public occasions, but \nalso private enterprise cases. The most representative enterprise cases include: \nDPOS is  an improved version of PoS  for permissioned purposes.  DPOS selects \nnodes (block producers)  as representatives to partake in later transaction validation \nwork [21]. At the initial stage of each round, a total of 21 block producers are selected \n(voted), among which 20 producers are chosen automatically while the remaining one \nwas chosen based on the voting proportion results of other producers. Then these 21 \nproducers will begin to validate blocks of transactions. As long as 15 producers out of \n21 reach consensus, a block is considered to be valid. \nIt is noticeable that the number of selected block producers, 21, is not an absolute \nunchangeable number. According to latest EOS Whitepaper, the number of super \nnodes can be voted by the community. However, why is number 21 chosen? \nFor the comprehensive consideration of efficiency and fairness, the DPoS consen-\nsus mechanism set up 21 super nodes as block producers. Firstly, there must be an \nodd number of nodes, because in EOS whitepaper, there is a \"most nodes  are just\" \nassumption, as well as a \u201clongest chain mechanism\u201d. The odd number of producers \ncan guarantee that only one longest chain exists.  \nSecondly, the originator, Daniel Larimer, first used 101 witness nodes when mak-\ning the first version of DPoS conse nsus mechanism, while in the upgraded version, \nthe number of 101 is changed to user -defined, so that people can freely adjust it when \nvoting. However, when a community is in a controllable state, the number of nodes \nthat can be voted is usually about 15. T herefore, when Daniel conducts the second \nDPoS project, the number of nodes is set slightly higher than 15 to 21, to ensure the \n\"decentralized\" operation under the controllable state. In EOS Whitepaper, there is a \nconfirmation of \"absolute irreversibility\", which requires the consent of more than 2/3 \nof the nodes. If the number of nodes is large, a longer waiting time is required for \nconfirmation. If the number of nodes is small, shorter waiting time is prone to some \nconcentration risks. It is understandabl e that 21 is a balance between decentralization \nand performance."], "response": "The two core proof-based algorithms mentioned in the document are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

On the other hand, Proof of Stake (PoS) is based on the amount of balance each miner possesses, which can lead to some miners relying solely on their stakes rather than contributing computational ability, resulting in lower transaction mobility.", "passing": true, "feedback": "YES", "score": 1.0, "pairwise_source": null, "invalid_result": false, "invalid_reason": null}, {"query": "What are the performance and scalability issues faced by typical blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum?", "contexts": ["3 \n \nScalability.

But due to the nature of central/control node (s), its trust \nis weaker than public blockchains. Security could also be weaker because a small \nnumber of nodes could easily decide the consensus used to validate transactions, ne-\ngating the original intent ion of the blockchains. Many early blockchain deployments \nuse private blockchains. \nHybrid blockchain combines the features of public and private chains. Such  a \nchain is controlled by a single organization, but with some oversight performed by the \npublic bl ockchain.  It can be used to partition some data and transactions behind a \npermission scheme while maintaining connections to the public chains.

This survey presents a comprehe nsive study of recent advances in \nblockchain technologies\uff0c focusing on how issues that affecting the enterprise \nadoption were progressively addressed from the original Bitcoin system to \nEthereum, to Solana etc. Key issues preventing the wide adoption are scalability \nand performance, while recent advances in Solana has clearly demonstrated that \nit is possible to significantly improve on those issues by innovating on data \nstructure, processes and algorithms by consolidating various time -consuming \nalgorithms and security enforcements, and differentiate and balance users and \ntheir responsibilities and rights, while maintaining the required security and in-\ntegrity that blockchain systems inherently offer.  \nKeywords: Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Consensus, Proof of Work, Proof \nof History Scalability, Performance, Security, \n1 Introduction \n1.1 Rise of Blockchain Technology \nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer -to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes \nsome well-articulated software constructs of algorithms, collaboratively peers to rec-\nord and negotiate the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of trans-\naction data together with cryptographic and security  enrichments to achieve integrity. \nIt was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and has been becoming a  mainstream tech-\nnology. It has be en used in various industries, such as  financial, healthcare, supply \nchain, logistics, and many other s. Such distributed ledgers are designed to provide a \npermanent, tamper -proof r ecord of business transactions, as they can be utilized to \nimprove collaboration, enable provenance, speed up transaction settlements or enable \ntransparency. \nBlockchain can also be viewed as  a decentralized database running on a peer -to-\npeer network, where each node/computer (or some selected group ) maintains a copy \nof the current ledger. It offers data security and reliability as the data cannot be easily \nmodified while the redundant copies make data loss unlikely.  \nBlockchain innovated in how digital information is stored, verified and exchanged, \nand was inherently designed and developed to create secure, reliable and transparent \nbusiness processes for enterprises.

Therefore, the concept of \u201cwallet address\u201d (or \u201c wal-\nlet\u201d) is introduced. This is because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor, refer enced the \nmodel of e-cash when designing the model. It is thus easy to understand that like cash \ncan be put in many places, a  Bitcoin user can have many wallets/addresses, with all \namounts of balance inside each adding up to the total. These amounts of balance are \ncalled \u201cunspent transaction outputs\u201d (UTXO).  \nUTXO comes from inputs of transactions  [9]. However, every input of UTXO is a \nseparate entity which must be used up at a time . Multiple inputs can be inserted in to \nan address, while up to two outputs can be initiated each time, one for a targeted re-\nceiver, the other for getting back the remaining bitcoins. Also, a transfer can be initi-\nated by changing UTXO\u2019s current address into the receiver\u2019s address. Only the sender \nwith the private key can have access and transfer its UTXO to another address  [10]. \nWith UTXO, a transaction in Bitcoin network is just the change of balance\u2019s address. \nFig. 5 shows how different components of the Bitcoin system work in a transaction \nprocess. Before a transaction, network must verify from the previous record whether \nthe sender has enough balance to send. After the validation from all miners (valida-\ntors) in the whole network, only the first miner who figure out the output is rewarded. \n \nAlice s wallet address\nBob s wallet address\nBalance Verification Transaction\nMiner \nValidationWinning miner rewarded\nUTXO\nBitcoin System\n \nFig. 5. Bitcoin system components \nThe above-mentioned transaction is recorded in transaction records. However, in \nBitcoin, one deficit with transaction history is apparent: increas ed verification com-\nplexity. When one transaction is initiated, at most two members\u2019 previous transactions \nwill be verified \u2013 one member is th e receiver and the other is the sender. These two \nmembers will be traced back for previous transaction records for the amounts of bal-\nance in their wallets. As time passes by, the transaction records have been accumulat-\ning, and the verification process will be more and more complicated.", "11 \n \nThis case above is only a one -transaction scenario. If more nodes are added to \nBitcoin, when doing transactions, transaction records from more nodes will be con-\nsidered for calculating balance of a single node, and this will also increase verification \ncomplexity. \nDuring transactions process, any changes to the transaction record is prohibited, \notherwise the whole chain will be considered invalid. Theoretically, there are up to 5 \nillegal changes: data content change, Merkle-tree reference change, transaction substi-\ntution, Merkle-root change and block-header reference change [11].  \nThe detection of changes is realized by checking changes in block header hash val-\nues. In Figure 6, we denote Transaction 1 to 4 as a part of the Merkle tree. If transac-\ntion 2 is changed or replaced, the value of R2 will also change, which will lead to the \nchange in R12 and R34. \n \nBlock Header 1\nR12\nR1 R2\nTransaction 1 Transaction 2\nBlock Header 1\nR34\nR3 R4\nTransaction 3 Transaction 4\nB1 B2\nTransaction \u03b1\n\u00d7\nHuge calculation\n\u00d7\nHuge calculation\n2 substitute by \u03b1\n \nFig. 6. Bitcoin illegal changes \nTo be more specific , once an element is changed, another element t hat points to it \nshould also be changed, as the lower -level hash values will influence the higher -level \nones. \n3.2 Ethereum \nEthereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. \nThe users of the network can create, publish, monetiz e, and use applications on the \nplatform, and use its cryptocurrency \u201cEther\u201d as payments. Two innovative concepts \nare introduced to Ethereum, smart contracts and account information. \nEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) [12] creates an environment for smart contr acts \nand makes it possible for anyone to create his own contracts and decentralized appli-\ncations (DApps)  [13]. This involves the definition of ownership rules, transaction \nmethods and state transition functions.  Smart contracts can further be expanded into \nbusiness and enterprise level. The codes and data inside represent principles and rules \nthat can be used to provide services according to different scenarios. Several factors \ncan be taken into account, such as internal management, member conducts, privacy  \netc. \nBesides, account [14] is also successfully implemented. There are two sorts of ac-\ncounts in Ethereum: External Owned Accounts (EOA)  [14] and Contract Accounts  \n(CA) [14]. EOA is an e-cash account which encompass balance ; while CA has both \nbalance state and contract state. With accounts, the state information, such as balance"], "response": "Bitcoin's concept of \"wallet address\" differs from traditional cash transactions in that a Bitcoin user can have multiple wallets/addresses, each containing a balance that adds up to the total.

These amounts of balance are \ncalled \u201cunspent transaction outputs\u201d (UTXO).  \nUTXO comes from inputs of transactions  [9]. However, every input of UTXO is a \nseparate entity which must be used up at a time . Multiple inputs can be inserted in to \nan address, while up to two outputs can be initiated each time, one for a targeted re-\nceiver, the other for getting back the remaining bitcoins.

Only the sender \nwith the private key can have access and transfer its UTXO to another address  [10]. \nWith UTXO, a transaction in Bitcoin network is just the change of balance\u2019s address. \nFig. 5 shows how different components of the Bitcoin system work in a transaction \nprocess.

Each node then shares its batch with  its peers to re-\nconstruct the original collection of 100 transactions.  The process of synchronization \nbetween verifiers is shown in Fig.13.

EOS has the following three main fea-\ntures [19]:  \n1. Low latency. The platform supports low latency with DPoS mechanism. \n2. Parallel Performance. The off -load can allocated among multiple CPUs and \ncomputers in terms of large-scale applications. This avoid heavy on -chain \nworkload.  \n3. Sequential Performance. Due to some limitations in sequentially dependent \nsteps, those applications that cannot support parallel algorithms will be \nprovided with fast sequential processing for high volumes. \nBy deploying DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism  [20], this \npermissioned EOS blockchain has become suitable for not only public occasions, but \nalso private enterprise cases. The most representative enterprise cases include: \nDPOS is  an improved version of PoS  for permissioned purposes.  DPOS selects \nnodes (block producers)  as representatives to partake in later transaction validation \nwork [21]. At the initial stage of each round, a total of 21 block producers are selected \n(voted), among which 20 producers are chosen automatically while the remaining one \nwas chosen based on the voting proportion results of other producers. Then these 21 \nproducers will begin to validate blocks of transactions. As long as 15 producers out of \n21 reach consensus, a block is considered to be valid. \nIt is noticeable that the number of selected block producers, 21, is not an absolute \nunchangeable number. According to latest EOS Whitepaper, the number of super \nnodes can be voted by the community. However, why is number 21 chosen? \nFor the comprehensive consideration of efficiency and fairness, the DPoS consen-\nsus mechanism set up 21 super nodes as block producers. Firstly, there must be an \nodd number of nodes, because in EOS whitepaper, there is a \"most nodes  are just\" \nassumption, as well as a \u201clongest chain mechanism\u201d. The odd number of producers \ncan guarantee that only one longest chain exists.  \nSecondly, the originator, Daniel Larimer, first used 101 witness nodes when mak-\ning the first version of DPoS conse nsus mechanism, while in the upgraded version, \nthe number of 101 is changed to user -defined, so that people can freely adjust it when \nvoting. However, when a community is in a controllable state, the number of nodes \nthat can be voted is usually about 15. T herefore, when Daniel conducts the second \nDPoS project, the number of nodes is set slightly higher than 15 to 21, to ensure the \n\"decentralized\" operation under the controllable state. In EOS Whitepaper, there is a \nconfirmation of \"absolute irreversibility\", which requires the consent of more than 2/3 \nof the nodes. If the number of nodes is large, a longer waiting time is required for \nconfirmation. If the number of nodes is small, shorter waiting time is prone to some \nconcentration risks. It is understandabl e that 21 is a balance between decentralization \nand performance.", "14 \n \n21 selected block producers\nConsensus   15/21\n......\n......\n......\n......\n......\n......\n......\n......\nOther block producers\n \nFig. 8. EOS Architecture \nThere is also rotation mechanism in the selection of producers: every three sec-\nonds, the 21 producers are selected from all producers ag ain. This means producers \nwithout enough computing power will be sifted out.  With no peer competition and \nshorter consensus confirmation time, it is  possible for EOS to improve its scalability \nand performance of TPS in each unit time  [22]. In Fig. 8, the principles of DPoS and \nthe rotation  \nEspecially in a company , this small -scale permissioned stake mechanism allows \nonly some directors, similar to the 21 selected block producers, to have the right in the \nincome, property, copyrights etc. in proportion to i nvestment or token in the account  \n[22].

Hyperledger Fabric Architecture \nThere are three main components in Hyperledger Fabric: Membership, Blockchain \nand Chaincode. Membership part provides identification services. Blockchain part \nprovides consensus services. Chaincode part is a program that acts as smart contracts \nin this system. In enterprise scenarios, each node could access this system through the \nmembership services.  \nThe network is permissioned because the participants are known to each other, ra-\nther than anonymous and therefore fully untrusted. This is the most distinct difference \nfrom the traditional public permissionless Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain system. \nThe whole system could use general-purpose programming languages such as Java, \nGo and Node.js, rather than constrained domain-specific languages. However, this \nuniform programming style and the strict identification process also limit the scalabil-\nity of the whole system [23].  \nThere are many smart contracts in this system and each maintains a specific type of \ntransaction. Different smart contracts are in charge of different types of transactions. \nThe smart contract will assign en dorsers in a specific type of transaction. The endors-\ner is a node which is qualified to validate this specific transaction. The smart contract \ncould also set requirements of completing some specific transaction. For example, it \ncould stipulate that a transaction is completed with validation from 2/3 of endorsers. \nWhen a transaction is initiated, some specific smart contract s will be triggered. \nThen this transaction will be sent to relevant endorser nodes, which will endorse this \ntransaction. If this transac tion is validated, then the result will be directly sent to the \nuser, but not committed on the chain. In this way, the transaction is executed before \nbeing validated by the system. Finally, all the transactions, no matter successful or \nnot, will be gathere d by the order node for the validation of the whole system.  This \n\u201cexecute-order-validate\u201d mechanism is shown in Fig. 10. \nThis \u201cexecute -order-validate\u201d mechanism greatly improve s the performance and \nscalability of the whole system. This first phase also eli minates any non-determinism, \nas inconsistent results can be filtered out before ordering. Because we have eliminated \nnon-determinism, Fabric is the first blockchain technology that enables use of stand-\nard programming languages, which in turn improve s the extensibility and scalability \nof the system.

Blockchain platform will drive the convergence \nof organizations towards a network -based economy. As companies are more tightly \ninterconnected and rely on business partners to develop, produce, and deliver products \nand services, they need to integrate resources and capabilities of the involved part-\nners, and engage in joint implementation and utilization of new technologies that are \napplied and integrated into their business processes.  \nBlockchain based technology naturally fits in and can inherently connect partners \nthroughout the ecosystem with the required security, enhanced trustworthy and relia-\nbility and integrity. Furthermore, blockchain is a very versatile technology and pro-\nvides the means for customization, as it is not limited to any specific area of applica-\ntion or purpose.  \nSeveral most critical issues that enterprises should first consider are: \n1. Is permissioned or permissionless blockchain best fit the business model? \nMost of the successful deployments are on permissioned private blockchains, \nas organizations really want control over who can participate, and at what \ncapacity.  \n2. What types of information truly needs the inherent security and integrity \nmechanisms that the blockchain technology provides? Required operations \nare computationally very expensive and need participation of many nodes. \nTherefore, certain combination of data models with different level of securi-\nty and integrity requirements should be established.  \n3.

As discussed earlier, the performance of a blockchain could be domi-\nnated by the least \u201cpowerful\u201d participating node in the network.

Instead results from the off -loaded expensive operations only need to be \nreflected in the main chain, bas ed on the \u201ctrust -worthiness\u201d of the partners. Further-", "6 \n \nConsensus issues. The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed."], "response": "Innovative data structures and algorithms can revolutionize blockchain technology by leveraging representational characteristics of transactions, such as identity information, business semantics, and temporal patterns.

To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in-\ntroduced, as discussed before.

Therefore, policies or even smart contracts could be \nutilized to restrict participants. \nTechnically, workloads can be distributed intelligently to reduce processing needs \nfor more \u201ccritical\u201d (either business or technical) nodes.  \nInteroperability and Sta ndardization. Another m ain challenge is the lack of in-\nteroperability among the large number of blockchain networks. Over 6,500 projects \nadopted a variety of blockchain platforms and solutions with different protocols, pro-\ngramming languages, consensus mechanisms, and privacy meas ures, while most of \nthose blockchains work in silos and do not communicate with other peer networks. \nThe lack of universal standards and uniformity across blockchain protocols further \ncolluded the situation. \nVarious projects have initiated to address this problem.

Therefore it is vital to establish  in-\ndustry-wide standards and protocols to help enterprises collaborate on application", "3 \n \nScalability. Scalability is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is \none of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.   \nThe system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us-\ners/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to \nscale up and down quickly as the number of users change drastically, as needed.  \nSecurity and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality, authentication and \nintegrity ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected . \nBlockchain benefits primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se-\ncurity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates a flow of data from \ncomplex mathematical operations that cannot be changed once created  without being \ndetected, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi-\ncantly more reliable than traditional journal methods. This unchangeable and i ncor-\nruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains safer and better protected against \ntampering and hacking of information.  \nVarious software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua-\nble/transactional data at many integration points. System architects need to understand \nlegal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to the development \nteam, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.  \nWith blockchains , an external audit can be provided from the distributed ledger. \nThis will inherently enhance privacy and avoid corruption, and help confirm the legit-\nimacy of transactions and offer indisputable proof of transactions. \nAvailability/Reliability/Resilience. The system must be availab le for use, and the  \ndowntime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances . For ex-\nample, mechanisms to avoid single points of failures, and adequate timeouts could be \nused to enhance system availability and reliability.  \nFeasibility. Feasibility considers issues such as technology maturity , time-to-\nmarket, total cost of ownership , technical knowl edge, and migration requirements. \nCommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, managed services and cloud-native func-\ntions where appropriate, and close collaboration with development partners with suit-\nable architecture  and solution components and services wi ll definite ly help address \nthose issues. . \nThis paper surveyed several important blockchain platforms covering the years of \nevolution from the original Bitcoin system to the more advanced recent offerings. \nHopefully, with the information we collected and a nalyzed, it could help enterprises \nto make better decisions, while also directs new players where to innovate in order  to \nmake blockchain well fit into most enterprises business needs.  We will review the \nchosen frameworks, especially their data structure s, processes and algorithms in-\nvolved in creating a new transaction record (block), and how conflicts or disputes \ncould be resolved in Section 2 . We will also raise concerns on several key issues re-\nlated to the afore -mentioned NFRs, especially the performance  and scalability.

Setup, configuration, \ncommitments and conformance to performance, scalability, availability, and some-\ntimes even security and privacy still remains difficult and perplexing.   \n4.3 Alternatives to Bockchain Technology \nDespite its promises, blockchain adoption has been very slow. Several alternatives to \nblockchain that provide b etter performance have emerged, offering organizations \noptions to reduce costs, simplify development and reduce integration challenges while \nstill able to enjoy some of the core benefits of blockchains.  \nAlternative Distributed Ledgers . A simplified distributed ledger, without the com-\nplexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative \nfor trusted decentralized applications. Several options are available, including Hash-\ngraph, Iota Tangle and R3 Corda. \nIota and Hashgraph use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative data \nstructure for maint aining the ledger \uff0c while DAG approach allows an ap plication to \nwrite data quickly, and requires permission to conduct certain operations  that could \nslow down the transaction . The applications need to be configured to notify users \nwhen conflicts occur, and built-in rules rules to help resolve. \nAn Iota Tangle stores data across a DAG where each node, or vertex, represents a \ntransaction. The network grows via transactions rather than through a compute -\nintensive mining process. Iota supports micropayments and transactions across IoT \ndevices. It is mostly decentralized, but it does require a coordinator node that oversees \nand confirms the addition of new transactions. \nHashgraph also eliminates the need  for mining to grow the ledger by utilizing its \n\u201cgossip about gossip \u201d protocol that network nodes use to share i nformation, come to \nconsensus (another key process in blockchain) and add new transactions to the DAG. \nAs new data is added, an audit trail is also appended to the distributed ledger.  \nCentralized ledgers. Amazon's Quantum Ledger Database simplifies the pr ocess of \nimplementing a shared database designed for ledger -like applications that provides a \ncryptographically verifiable audit trail without all the overhead of a distributed ledger \nor blockchain. It promises the  immutability and verifiability of blockchain  combined \nwith the ease and scalability of a traditional cloud service \u3002One thing worth noting is \nthat the blockchain could still be a better option with untrusted players. \nDistributed databases. Distributed databases offer ome combination of data replica-\ntion and duplication to ensure data consistency and integrity . For examp le, the Or-\nbitDB [45] open source project was built on top of a distributed filesystem that allows \noperation even if one node goes down,  and  can support the creation of a dis tributed, \npeer-to-peer databases, and it enables organizations to develop decentralized applica-"], "response": "Decentralized storage systems like IPFS and Storj mentioned in the document offer advantages such as reduced bandwidth requirements, improved resilience, and less susceptibility to censorship.

As organizations have \nstarted to explore and experiment with blockchain\u2019s potential by developing block-\nchain applications, the proper choice of a \u201cgood\u201d blockchain platform becomes vital. \nAs they become increasingly more popular, enterprises need better information to \nmake right judgement calls to decide not only when to jump into the tech wago n, but \nmore importantly how they can take advantage of the new technology while avoiding \npotential pitfalls.  \nBlockchain and smart contracts make it possible for multiple parties to share busi-\nness logic and collaboratively conduct business processes/operations automatically. \nProperly utilized, it can  reduce IT costs, expand B2B and B2C networks, enable new \nproducts and service that could bring in revenue and profits . Moreover, blockchain's \nbusiness value is expected to increase as enterprise implementations proliferate and \nare further extended and refined.  \n1.2 Issues facing Enterprise Adoption of Blockchain Technology \nThis paper will not cover whether blockchain technology fits enterprises from the \nbusiness perspective, although that should be the first question to ask. We will focus \non non-functional requirements that describes the system\u2019s operation capabilities and \nconstraints that enhance its business functionality. The non -functional requirements \nneeded for application will of course depend on the business context and the out-\ncomes to be achieved, particularly as there are so many that can be applied. In this \npaper, we will only elaborate a few most critical ones. \nPerformance. All enterprise systems should be designed and built with an acceptable  \nstandard of performance as a minimum, while t aking into accoun ts problems such \nas scalability, latency, load and resource utilization. Many factors could negatively \nimpact p erformance, including  high numbers of API calls, poor caching, and high -\nload third-party services. It\u2019s critical  to ensure the end -user experience or integration \nof multi-systems across the entire eco-chain is not affected by any such issues. \nPrevailing business transaction systems have been capable of processing thousands \n(Visa, for example) or millions of transactions (online market place such as Amazon \nor Alibaba) per second without any failure, most of the cu rrent blockchain platform s \ndepicted a remarkable slowdown, making them unviable for large -scale or perf or-\nmance-sensitive applications. For example, Bitcoin can only process roughly 3 to 7 \ntransactions per second, with Ethereum about 15 to 20 transactions.  \nSuch poor performance and cumbersome  operations are  mainly d ue to the com-\nplexity with encrypted and distributed nature in blockchains. Although it is not at all \nsuitable for high-frequency transactions, ways to improve its transaction performance, \nincluding throughput and latency, is always a hot topic.  Compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d \npayment systems such as cash or debit cards , it could take hours or even days to pro-\ncess some transactions. When more users join the netwo rk, its performance will be \nfurther degraded due to the existence of consensus latency from nodes with low pro-\ncessing power. As a result, the transactions cost is higher than usual, further limiting \nmore users onto the network.", "3 \n \nScalability. Scalability is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is \none of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.   \nThe system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us-\ners/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to \nscale up and down quickly as the number of users change drastically, as needed.  \nSecurity and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality, authentication and \nintegrity ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected . \nBlockchain benefits primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se-\ncurity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates a flow of data from \ncomplex mathematical operations that cannot be changed once created  without being \ndetected, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi-\ncantly more reliable than traditional journal methods. This unchangeable and i ncor-\nruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains safer and better protected against \ntampering and hacking of information.  \nVarious software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua-\nble/transactional data at many integration points. System architects need to understand \nlegal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to the development \nteam, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.  \nWith blockchains , an external audit can be provided from the distributed ledger. \nThis will inherently enhance privacy and avoid corruption, and help confirm the legit-\nimacy of transactions and offer indisputable proof of transactions. \nAvailability/Reliability/Resilience. The system must be availab le for use, and the  \ndowntime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances . For ex-\nample, mechanisms to avoid single points of failures, and adequate timeouts could be \nused to enhance system availability and reliability.  \nFeasibility. Feasibility considers issues such as technology maturity , time-to-\nmarket, total cost of ownership , technical knowl edge, and migration requirements. \nCommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, managed services and cloud-native func-\ntions where appropriate, and close collaboration with development partners with suit-\nable architecture  and solution components and services wi ll definite ly help address \nthose issues. . \nThis paper surveyed several important blockchain platforms covering the years of \nevolution from the original Bitcoin system to the more advanced recent offerings. \nHopefully, with the information we collected and a nalyzed, it could help enterprises \nto make better decisions, while also directs new players where to innovate in order  to \nmake blockchain well fit into most enterprises business needs.  We will review the \nchosen frameworks, especially their data structure s, processes and algorithms in-\nvolved in creating a new transaction record (block), and how conflicts or disputes \ncould be resolved in Section 2 . We will also raise concerns on several key issues re-\nlated to the afore -mentioned NFRs, especially the performance  and scalability.

The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed.", "13 \n \n EOS provides not only tools for DApps, but also solutions for scalability issues, \nwhich we will further discuss in Section 3.5.  EOS has the following three main fea-\ntures [19]:  \n1. Low latency. The platform supports low latency with DPoS mechanism. \n2. Parallel Performance. The off -load can allocated among multiple CPUs and \ncomputers in terms of large-scale applications. This avoid heavy on -chain \nworkload.  \n3. Sequential Performance. Due to some limitations in sequentially dependent \nsteps, those applications that cannot support parallel algorithms will be \nprovided with fast sequential processing for high volumes. \nBy deploying DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism  [20], this \npermissioned EOS blockchain has become suitable for not only public occasions, but \nalso private enterprise cases. The most representative enterprise cases include: \nDPOS is  an improved version of PoS  for permissioned purposes.  DPOS selects \nnodes (block producers)  as representatives to partake in later transaction validation \nwork [21]. At the initial stage of each round, a total of 21 block producers are selected \n(voted), among which 20 producers are chosen automatically while the remaining one \nwas chosen based on the voting proportion results of other producers. Then these 21 \nproducers will begin to validate blocks of transactions. As long as 15 producers out of \n21 reach consensus, a block is considered to be valid. \nIt is noticeable that the number of selected block producers, 21, is not an absolute \nunchangeable number. According to latest EOS Whitepaper, the number of super \nnodes can be voted by the community. However, why is number 21 chosen? \nFor the comprehensive consideration of efficiency and fairness, the DPoS consen-\nsus mechanism set up 21 super nodes as block producers. Firstly, there must be an \nodd number of nodes, because in EOS whitepaper, there is a \"most nodes  are just\" \nassumption, as well as a \u201clongest chain mechanism\u201d. The odd number of producers \ncan guarantee that only one longest chain exists.  \nSecondly, the originator, Daniel Larimer, first used 101 witness nodes when mak-\ning the first version of DPoS conse nsus mechanism, while in the upgraded version, \nthe number of 101 is changed to user -defined, so that people can freely adjust it when \nvoting. However, when a community is in a controllable state, the number of nodes \nthat can be voted is usually about 15. T herefore, when Daniel conducts the second \nDPoS project, the number of nodes is set slightly higher than 15 to 21, to ensure the \n\"decentralized\" operation under the controllable state. In EOS Whitepaper, there is a \nconfirmation of \"absolute irreversibility\", which requires the consent of more than 2/3 \nof the nodes. If the number of nodes is large, a longer waiting time is required for \nconfirmation. If the number of nodes is small, shorter waiting time is prone to some \nconcentration risks. It is understandabl e that 21 is a balance between decentralization \nand performance."], "response": "The advantages of Proof of Work (PoW) include incentivizing nodes to participate in transaction processing and ensuring security through computational work. However, PoW is criticized for its high energy consumption and inefficiency in terms of transaction processing speed. On the other hand, Proof of Stake (PoS) rewards miners based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, reducing energy consumption compared to PoW. Nevertheless, PoS can lead to centralization as wealthy miners have more influence.

As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed.", "18.

Development of Blockchain platforms \nBitcoin and Ethereum are  the top 2 well-known public blockchain platforms. \nBitcoin is the first realization of blockchain and brings in consensus algorithms in a \npeer-to-peer system. Ethereum modify the traditional bitcoin structure by successfully \nimplementing accounts and smart contracts. However, these public blockchains have \ntheir deficits in scalability and performance. \nUnder such circumstances, the private blockchain and consortium blockchain come \ninto sight. Hyperledger Fabric and EOS are two enterprise blockchain  platforms.

Solana  considerably exceled in terms of its high transaction  performance with \nimproved consensuses. Hopefully, if Solana is adopted in enterprise blockchain  in-\nstead of the existing platforms like Hyperledger Fabric and EOS , the company effi-\nciency can be considerably increased. \nNevertheless, blockchain technology is  still under development and man limita-\ntions are still need to be further exploited and ameliorated. We will discus these pos-\nsibilities in the following sections."], "response": "Hyperledger Fabric and EOS are examples of permissioned blockchain solutions for enterprises mentioned in the document.", "passing": true, "feedback": "YES", "score": 1.0, "pairwise_source": null, "invalid_result": false, "invalid_reason": null}, {"query": "How does the Solana blockchain platform compare to directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology in terms of distributed ledger technology?", "contexts": ["18 \n \nbecause DAG system needn\u2019t to synchronize. Considering there can be repeated \ntransactions in each slot, the improvement on TPS is not linear, but implementing this \nDAG data structure can improve the efficiency of the whole system. The nature of \nasynchronization also extends the scalability of the system. The difficulty of modifi-\ncation in this system is tremendous because there are many inputs and outputs in one \nslot and one modification can introduce a series of mistakes, so DAG system can \nprovide users with integrity. \n3.6 Solana \nSolana is a blockchain system which brings tremendous improvement to the perfor-\nmance of traditional bloc kchain and makes it possible to  build scalable and user -\nfriendly applications for the world. It possesses all attributes of traditional blockchain \nsystems but the performance is much better.  To improve performance of traditional \nblockchain system, Solana introduce the Proof of History mechanism. \nIn Solana system There are two kinds of nodes: Leader and Verifier. The Leader is \nan elected Proof of History generator, and Solana rotates leaders at fixed intervals.  \nThe components of Solana are shown in Fig.  12 The leader will receive the transac-\ntions coming from users and order them into a Proof of History sequence. \nProof of History is a mechanism used in Solana. The Proof of History sequence is a \nlist of transactions. The transactions are prearranged by a \u201cLeade r\u201d, and the \ntimestamp is embodied in this data structure. Every event has a unique hash and ac-\ncount along this data structure. As a function of real time, this info rmation tells us \nwhat event had come before another. For example, if we want to know the has h value \nwhen index is 300, the only way is to run this algorithm 300 times. We can know that \nthere is real time elapsing in this process from this specific data structure. Time can-\nnot be faked and the future can also not be forecasted. In this way, this sy stem will no \nlonger need to waste computing resources on synchronizing time, because time is \npreconfigured and unchangeable.  \n \nUser1 User2 User3\nLeader (PoH Sequence \nGenerator)\nTransaction3\nTransaction2\nTransaction1\nVerifier1\nVerifier2\nTransaction3\nBatch1\nBatch2", "24 \n \nagement of smart contracts , and also c onnection to its CloudMonitor for real -time \nalerts and monitoring.  \nEven though all those nice features are marked \u201cas a service\u201d, they are still lack of \nthe required standard-based \u201copenness\u201d and \u201cinteroperability\u201d. Setup, configuration, \ncommitments and conformance to performance, scalability, availability, and some-\ntimes even security and privacy still remains difficult and perplexing.   \n4.3 Alternatives to Bockchain Technology \nDespite its promises, blockchain adoption has been very slow. Several alternatives to \nblockchain that provide b etter performance have emerged, offering organizations \noptions to reduce costs, simplify development and reduce integration challenges while \nstill able to enjoy some of the core benefits of blockchains.  \nAlternative Distributed Ledgers . A simplified distributed ledger, without the com-\nplexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative \nfor trusted decentralized applications. Several options are available, including Hash-\ngraph, Iota Tangle and R3 Corda. \nIota and Hashgraph use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative data \nstructure for maint aining the ledger \uff0c while DAG approach allows an ap plication to \nwrite data quickly, and requires permission to conduct certain operations  that could \nslow down the transaction . The applications need to be configured to notify users \nwhen conflicts occur, and built-in rules rules to help resolve. \nAn Iota Tangle stores data across a DAG where each node, or vertex, represents a \ntransaction. The network grows via transactions rather than through a compute -\nintensive mining process. Iota supports micropayments and transactions across IoT \ndevices. It is mostly decentralized, but it does require a coordinator node that oversees \nand confirms the addition of new transactions. \nHashgraph also eliminates the need  for mining to grow the ledger by utilizing its \n\u201cgossip about gossip \u201d protocol that network nodes use to share i nformation, come to \nconsensus (another key process in blockchain) and add new transactions to the DAG. \nAs new data is added, an audit trail is also appended to the distributed ledger.  \nCentralized ledgers. Amazon's Quantum Ledger Database simplifies the pr ocess of \nimplementing a shared database designed for ledger -like applications that provides a \ncryptographically verifiable audit trail without all the overhead of a distributed ledger \nor blockchain. It promises the  immutability and verifiability of blockchain  combined \nwith the ease and scalability of a traditional cloud service \u3002One thing worth noting is \nthat the blockchain could still be a better option with untrusted players. \nDistributed databases. Distributed databases offer ome combination of data replica-\ntion and duplication to ensure data consistency and integrity . For examp le, the Or-\nbitDB [45] open source project was built on top of a distributed filesystem that allows \noperation even if one node goes down,  and  can support the creation of a dis tributed, \npeer-to-peer databases, and it enables organizations to develop decentralized applica-"], "response": "Solana, as a blockchain platform, introduces the Proof of History mechanism to improve performance.

DAG allows for quick data writing and permissioned operations, but may require notifications and rules to resolve conflicts.

This survey presents a comprehe nsive study of recent advances in \nblockchain technologies\uff0c focusing on how issues that affecting the enterprise \nadoption were progressively addressed from the original Bitcoin system to \nEthereum, to Solana etc. Key issues preventing the wide adoption are scalability \nand performance, while recent advances in Solana has clearly demonstrated that \nit is possible to significantly improve on those issues by innovating on data \nstructure, processes and algorithms by consolidating various time -consuming \nalgorithms and security enforcements, and differentiate and balance users and \ntheir responsibilities and rights, while maintaining the required security and in-\ntegrity that blockchain systems inherently offer.  \nKeywords: Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Consensus, Proof of Work, Proof \nof History Scalability, Performance, Security, \n1 Introduction \n1.1 Rise of Blockchain Technology \nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer -to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes \nsome well-articulated software constructs of algorithms, collaboratively peers to rec-\nord and negotiate the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of trans-\naction data together with cryptographic and security  enrichments to achieve integrity. \nIt was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and has been becoming a  mainstream tech-\nnology. It has be en used in various industries, such as  financial, healthcare, supply \nchain, logistics, and many other s. Such distributed ledgers are designed to provide a \npermanent, tamper -proof r ecord of business transactions, as they can be utilized to \nimprove collaboration, enable provenance, speed up transaction settlements or enable \ntransparency. \nBlockchain can also be viewed as  a decentralized database running on a peer -to-\npeer network, where each node/computer (or some selected group ) maintains a copy \nof the current ledger. It offers data security and reliability as the data cannot be easily \nmodified while the redundant copies make data loss unlikely.  \nBlockchain innovated in how digital information is stored, verified and exchanged, \nand was inherently designed and developed to create secure, reliable and transparent \nbusiness processes for enterprises. One of the surveys reveals that the global block-", "2 \n \nchain market size is expected to grow from USD 3.0 billion in 2020 to USD 39.7 \nbillion in 2025, at a CAGR of 67.3% during 2020 -2025 [1]. As organizations have \nstarted to explore and experiment with blockchain\u2019s potential by developing block-\nchain applications, the proper choice of a \u201cgood\u201d blockchain platform becomes vital. \nAs they become increasingly more popular, enterprises need better information to \nmake right judgement calls to decide not only when to jump into the tech wago n, but \nmore importantly how they can take advantage of the new technology while avoiding \npotential pitfalls.  \nBlockchain and smart contracts make it possible for multiple parties to share busi-\nness logic and collaboratively conduct business processes/operations automatically. \nProperly utilized, it can  reduce IT costs, expand B2B and B2C networks, enable new \nproducts and service that could bring in revenue and profits . Moreover, blockchain's \nbusiness value is expected to increase as enterprise implementations proliferate and \nare further extended and refined.  \n1.2 Issues facing Enterprise Adoption of Blockchain Technology \nThis paper will not cover whether blockchain technology fits enterprises from the \nbusiness perspective, although that should be the first question to ask. We will focus \non non-functional requirements that describes the system\u2019s operation capabilities and \nconstraints that enhance its business functionality. The non -functional requirements \nneeded for application will of course depend on the business context and the out-\ncomes to be achieved, particularly as there are so many that can be applied. In this \npaper, we will only elaborate a few most critical ones. \nPerformance. All enterprise systems should be designed and built with an acceptable  \nstandard of performance as a minimum, while t aking into accoun ts problems such \nas scalability, latency, load and resource utilization. Many factors could negatively \nimpact p erformance, including  high numbers of API calls, poor caching, and high -\nload third-party services. It\u2019s critical  to ensure the end -user experience or integration \nof multi-systems across the entire eco-chain is not affected by any such issues. \nPrevailing business transaction systems have been capable of processing thousands \n(Visa, for example) or millions of transactions (online market place such as Amazon \nor Alibaba) per second without any failure, most of the cu rrent blockchain platform s \ndepicted a remarkable slowdown, making them unviable for large -scale or perf or-\nmance-sensitive applications. For example, Bitcoin can only process roughly 3 to 7 \ntransactions per second, with Ethereum about 15 to 20 transactions.  \nSuch poor performance and cumbersome  operations are  mainly d ue to the com-\nplexity with encrypted and distributed nature in blockchains. Although it is not at all \nsuitable for high-frequency transactions, ways to improve its transaction performance, \nincluding throughput and latency, is always a hot topic.  Compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d \npayment systems such as cash or debit cards , it could take hours or even days to pro-\ncess some transactions. When more users join the netwo rk, its performance will be \nfurther degraded due to the existence of consensus latency from nodes with low pro-\ncessing power. As a result, the transactions cost is higher than usual, further limiting \nmore users onto the network."], "response": "The key issues preventing the wide adoption of blockchain technology in enterprise applications are scalability and performance.

Several alternatives to \nblockchain that provide b etter performance have emerged, offering organizations \noptions to reduce costs, simplify development and reduce integration challenges while \nstill able to enjoy some of the core benefits of blockchains.  \nAlternative Distributed Ledgers . A simplified distributed ledger, without the com-\nplexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative \nfor trusted decentralized applications. Several options are available, including Hash-\ngraph, Iota Tangle and R3 Corda. \nIota and Hashgraph use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative data \nstructure for maint aining the ledger \uff0c while DAG approach allows an ap plication to \nwrite data quickly, and requires permission to conduct certain operations  that could \nslow down the transaction . The applications need to be configured to notify users \nwhen conflicts occur, and built-in rules rules to help resolve. \nAn Iota Tangle stores data across a DAG where each node, or vertex, represents a \ntransaction. The network grows via transactions rather than through a compute -\nintensive mining process. Iota supports micropayments and transactions across IoT \ndevices. It is mostly decentralized, but it does require a coordinator node that oversees \nand confirms the addition of new transactions. \nHashgraph also eliminates the need  for mining to grow the ledger by utilizing its \n\u201cgossip about gossip \u201d protocol that network nodes use to share i nformation, come to \nconsensus (another key process in blockchain) and add new transactions to the DAG. \nAs new data is added, an audit trail is also appended to the distributed ledger.  \nCentralized ledgers. Amazon's Quantum Ledger Database simplifies the pr ocess of \nimplementing a shared database designed for ledger -like applications that provides a \ncryptographically verifiable audit trail without all the overhead of a distributed ledger \nor blockchain. It promises the  immutability and verifiability of blockchain  combined \nwith the ease and scalability of a traditional cloud service \u3002One thing worth noting is \nthat the blockchain could still be a better option with untrusted players. \nDistributed databases. Distributed databases offer ome combination of data replica-\ntion and duplication to ensure data consistency and integrity .

It has be en used in various industries, such as  financial, healthcare, supply \nchain, logistics, and many other s. Such distributed ledgers are designed to provide a \npermanent, tamper -proof r ecord of business transactions, as they can be utilized to \nimprove collaboration, enable provenance, speed up transaction settlements or enable \ntransparency. \nBlockchain can also be viewed as  a decentralized database running on a peer -to-\npeer network, where each node/computer (or some selected group ) maintains a copy \nof the current ledger. It offers data security and reliability as the data cannot be easily \nmodified while the redundant copies make data loss unlikely.  \nBlockchain innovated in how digital information is stored, verified and exchanged, \nand was inherently designed and developed to create secure, reliable and transparent \nbusiness processes for enterprises.

But this is more of a busi-\nness problem, as it may introduce changes to the business processes and the interac-\ntion patterns that need to be properly addressed from the strategy perspectives. \nScalability. To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in-\ntroduced, as discussed before. For example, with the  Lightning Network  [32] of \nBitcoin, a second layer to the main blockchain network is added in order to facilitate \nfaster transactions . Plasma [33] of Et hereum has a parent -child structure, processes \nthe transactions in the child -chain, and records the results in the parent -chain. Shar-\nding [34] groups subsets of nodes into smaller networks or \u2018shards\u2019 that are responsi-\nble for the transactions specific to t heir shard. When offered in conjunction with the \nproof-of-stake consensus mechanism, such mechanisms have the potential to scale up \nthe application. \nAs summarized in Table 1, private blockchain offer much better scalability, as the \nnodes in the network are purposely designed and enabled to process transactions in an \nenvironment of trusted parties. Therefore, some hybrid chains effectively combining \npublic chains for certain transactions, while employing private chains for other types \nof transactions would provide the best combination. \nIn addition, in almost all known business applications, it is not required to have \neveryone on the eco-system to participate or contribute to establish and maintain the \nintegrity of the distributed ledger. Therefore, policies or even smart contracts could be \nutilized to restrict participants. \nTechnically, workloads can be distributed intelligently to reduce processing needs \nfor more \u201ccritical\u201d (either business or technical) nodes.  \nInteroperability and Sta ndardization. Another m ain challenge is the lack of in-\nteroperability among the large number of blockchain networks. Over 6,500 projects \nadopted a variety of blockchain platforms and solutions with different protocols, pro-\ngramming languages, consensus mechanisms, and privacy meas ures, while most of \nthose blockchains work in silos and do not communicate with other peer networks. \nThe lack of universal standards and uniformity across blockchain protocols further \ncolluded the situation. \nVarious projects have initiated to address this problem. Ark uses SmartBridges [35] \narchitecture to bridge the gap of comm unication between the networks and it claims \nto offer unive rsal, cross-blockchain transmission and transfer with global interopera-\nbility. Cosmos [36] uses the Interblockchain Communi cation (IBC) protocol [37] to \nenable blockchain economies to operate outside silos, and trans fer files between each \nother. \nThe lack of standardization also impacts interoperability and eventually lead to in-\ncreased costs that  make mass adoption difficult. Therefore it is vital to establish  in-\ndustry-wide standards and protocols to help enterprises collaborate on application", "21 \n \nthe original Bitcoin and Ethereaum by 2 -4 orders of magnitude, from single digits to \nover 60000 TPSs.  \n4.2 Some Key Issues to be Further Investigated and Enhanced  \nData Structures  and Algorithms . From the original block structure to Merkel tree \nwith levels of hashed information, to DAG in Corda, it is evident that  significant im-\nprovements are still possible by innovating on underlying data structures that take ad-\nvantage of the representational characteristics of the transactions, especially their iden-\ntity information or business implications (\u201csmart ID\u201d[ 29]), business semantics [ 30], \ntemporal patterns [31], etc. With matching algorithms to enforce security and integrity, \nthey will definitely revolutionize the blockchain technology. In this regard, some self-\norganizing and potentially self-evolving structures\uff0c together with the help from artifi-\ncial intelligence and machine learning ( AI/ML), could be better fit while they could \nautomatically do only what\u2019s necessary and sufficient.  \nWith such innovative structures, algorithms can be further researched  that take ad-\nvantage of the full spectrum of analytical, stochastic and optimization, and of course \nAI/ML methods. Only in this way, the inefficiency of the cumbersome consensus and \nverification process prevailing in the current blockchain platforms can be  eventually \nsolved. \nData Models and Governance. As essentially \u201cevery company is a data company \u201d, \nblockchains potentially generate significant amount of new data to provide  the re-\nquired privacy and security , resilience and irreversibility. If bad data are offered cor-\nrectly or if the data store  contains false information but is offered right, they will all \nend up on the system.  \nAs some high impact incidences of data loss and breach were reported that could \ndiscourage companies from transitioning to blockchains, data governance has become \nmore critical. Poor execution of smart contracts could result in bad automated decision-\nmaking that could lead to tremendous business risks. Data privacy still remains as a \nchallenging issue while enterprise blockchain projects need to remedy. \nPerformance. As discussed earlier, the performance of a blockchain could be domi-\nnated by the least \u201cpowerful\u201d participating node in the network. So as Solana did, \nhow to effectively enforce some minimal standards on certain node capabilities, and \nfurther classify nodes into different groups with relevant rights and privileges without \nsacrificing the integrity assurance, could be appealing. It is even better if we can make \nsuch decisions adaptive to the business applications and workloads. \nIt is also feasible to off -load some heavy processing to a secondary support chain \nor system, while the main blockchain is only used to record the final result of the \ntransactions. For example, organizations always maintain some lists of \u201ctrusted\u201d or \n\u201ctrust-worthy\u201d clients, conducti ng transactions with those clients do not necessarily \nneed on-time completion of all the complex hashing operations for the entire distrib-\nuted ledger. Instead results from the off -loaded expensive operations only need to be \nreflected in the main chain, bas ed on the \u201ctrust -worthiness\u201d of the partners.

The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed.", "13 \n \n EOS provides not only tools for DApps, but also solutions for scalability issues, \nwhich we will further discuss in Section 3.5.  EOS has the following three main fea-\ntures [19]:  \n1. Low latency. The platform supports low latency with DPoS mechanism. \n2. Parallel Performance. The off -load can allocated among multiple CPUs and \ncomputers in terms of large-scale applications. This avoid heavy on -chain \nworkload.  \n3. Sequential Performance. Due to some limitations in sequentially dependent \nsteps, those applications that cannot support parallel algorithms will be \nprovided with fast sequential processing for high volumes. \nBy deploying DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism  [20], this \npermissioned EOS blockchain has become suitable for not only public occasions, but \nalso private enterprise cases. The most representative enterprise cases include: \nDPOS is  an improved version of PoS  for permissioned purposes.  DPOS selects \nnodes (block producers)  as representatives to partake in later transaction validation \nwork [21]. At the initial stage of each round, a total of 21 block producers are selected \n(voted), among which 20 producers are chosen automatically while the remaining one \nwas chosen based on the voting proportion results of other producers. Then these 21 \nproducers will begin to validate blocks of transactions. As long as 15 producers out of \n21 reach consensus, a block is considered to be valid. \nIt is noticeable that the number of selected block producers, 21, is not an absolute \nunchangeable number. According to latest EOS Whitepaper, the number of super \nnodes can be voted by the community. However, why is number 21 chosen? \nFor the comprehensive consideration of efficiency and fairness, the DPoS consen-\nsus mechanism set up 21 super nodes as block producers. Firstly, there must be an \nodd number of nodes, because in EOS whitepaper, there is a \"most nodes  are just\" \nassumption, as well as a \u201clongest chain mechanism\u201d. The odd number of producers \ncan guarantee that only one longest chain exists.  \nSecondly, the originator, Daniel Larimer, first used 101 witness nodes when mak-\ning the first version of DPoS conse nsus mechanism, while in the upgraded version, \nthe number of 101 is changed to user -defined, so that people can freely adjust it when \nvoting. However, when a community is in a controllable state, the number of nodes \nthat can be voted is usually about 15. T herefore, when Daniel conducts the second \nDPoS project, the number of nodes is set slightly higher than 15 to 21, to ensure the \n\"decentralized\" operation under the controllable state. In EOS Whitepaper, there is a \nconfirmation of \"absolute irreversibility\", which requires the consent of more than 2/3 \nof the nodes. If the number of nodes is large, a longer waiting time is required for \nconfirmation. If the number of nodes is small, shorter waiting time is prone to some \nconcentration risks. It is understandabl e that 21 is a balance between decentralization \nand performance."], "response": "The two core proof-based algorithms mentioned in the document are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Scalability is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is \none of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.   \nThe system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us-\ners/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to \nscale up and down quickly as the number of users change drastically, as needed.  \nSecurity and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality, authentication and \nintegrity ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected . \nBlockchain benefits primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se-\ncurity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates a flow of data from \ncomplex mathematical operations that cannot be changed once created  without being \ndetected, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi-\ncantly more reliable than traditional journal methods. This unchangeable and i ncor-\nruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains safer and better protected against \ntampering and hacking of information.  \nVarious software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua-\nble/transactional data at many integration points. System architects need to understand \nlegal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to the development \nteam, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.  \nWith blockchains , an external audit can be provided from the distributed ledger. \nThis will inherently enhance privacy and avoid corruption, and help confirm the legit-\nimacy of transactions and offer indisputable proof of transactions. \nAvailability/Reliability/Resilience. The system must be availab le for use, and the  \ndowntime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances .

Scalability is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is \none of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.   \nThe system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us-\ners/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to \nscale up and down quickly as the number of users change drastically, as needed.  \nSecurity and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality, authentication and \nintegrity ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected . \nBlockchain benefits primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se-\ncurity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates a flow of data from \ncomplex mathematical operations that cannot be changed once created  without being \ndetected, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi-\ncantly more reliable than traditional journal methods. This unchangeable and i ncor-\nruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains safer and better protected against \ntampering and hacking of information.  \nVarious software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua-\nble/transactional data at many integration points. System architects need to understand \nlegal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to the development \nteam, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.  \nWith blockchains , an external audit can be provided from the distributed ledger. \nThis will inherently enhance privacy and avoid corruption, and help confirm the legit-\nimacy of transactions and offer indisputable proof of transactions. \nAvailability/Reliability/Resilience. The system must be availab le for use, and the  \ndowntime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances . For ex-\nample, mechanisms to avoid single points of failures, and adequate timeouts could be \nused to enhance system availability and reliability.  \nFeasibility. Feasibility considers issues such as technology maturity , time-to-\nmarket, total cost of ownership , technical knowl edge, and migration requirements. \nCommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, managed services and cloud-native func-\ntions where appropriate, and close collaboration with development partners with suit-\nable architecture  and solution components and services wi ll definite ly help address \nthose issues. . \nThis paper surveyed several important blockchain platforms covering the years of \nevolution from the original Bitcoin system to the more advanced recent offerings. \nHopefully, with the information we collected and a nalyzed, it could help enterprises \nto make better decisions, while also directs new players where to innovate in order  to \nmake blockchain well fit into most enterprises business needs.  We will review the \nchosen frameworks, especially their data structure s, processes and algorithms in-\nvolved in creating a new transaction record (block), and how conflicts or disputes \ncould be resolved in Section 2 .

This survey presents a comprehe nsive study of recent advances in \nblockchain technologies\uff0c focusing on how issues that affecting the enterprise \nadoption were progressively addressed from the original Bitcoin system to \nEthereum, to Solana etc. Key issues preventing the wide adoption are scalability \nand performance, while recent advances in Solana has clearly demonstrated that \nit is possible to significantly improve on those issues by innovating on data \nstructure, processes and algorithms by consolidating various time -consuming \nalgorithms and security enforcements, and differentiate and balance users and \ntheir responsibilities and rights, while maintaining the required security and in-\ntegrity that blockchain systems inherently offer.  \nKeywords: Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Consensus, Proof of Work, Proof \nof History Scalability, Performance, Security, \n1 Introduction \n1.1 Rise of Blockchain Technology \nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer -to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes \nsome well-articulated software constructs of algorithms, collaboratively peers to rec-\nord and negotiate the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of trans-\naction data together with cryptographic and security  enrichments to achieve integrity. \nIt was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and has been becoming a  mainstream tech-\nnology.

As all miners are rewarded in a transaction,  Gas [16], \nwhich can be converted into Ether later, is introduced to restrict the usage of  re-\nsources. Specifically, to take environment factors into account, such as  bandwidth, \ncomputational complexity and storage space, Gas value is adjusted after current trans-\naction for the next one. \nFig. 7 shows how the above smart contracts and account states are used in the \ntransaction [17]. Before a new transaction  starts, gas value is decided based on \nEthereum network conditions. As Fig. 7 depicts, Alice first initiate the transaction and \nthen broadcast the whole network. This transaction is added to a block and then min-\ners begin validating. Every miner is reward for its effort with Gas, the amount of \nwhich depends on contributions in validating a block. \n \nAlice s account\nBob s account\nTransaction Miners Valiation\nEach mist awardedSet Gas\nGas set Smart Contract\nEOA CA\nEOA CA\nAccount\nTransaction\nGas\nStorage\nMessage \ncall\nLog\nInstruction \nSet\nCode \nLibrary\nEthereum System\n \nFig. 7.

If more nodes are added to \nBitcoin, when doing transactions, transaction records from more nodes will be con-\nsidered for calculating balance of a single node, and this will also increase verification \ncomplexity. \nDuring transactions process, any changes to the transaction record is prohibited, \notherwise the whole chain will be considered invalid. Theoretically, there are up to 5 \nillegal changes: data content change, Merkle-tree reference change, transaction substi-\ntution, Merkle-root change and block-header reference change [11].  \nThe detection of changes is realized by checking changes in block header hash val-\nues. In Figure 6, we denote Transaction 1 to 4 as a part of the Merkle tree.

But whether certain technology really fits the business has bec ome increasingly \ncritical as it i s almost inevitable that technology will be a part of the business or its \nsolution. Any change in the business strategy or model will propagate through the \ncompany\u2019s technology paradigm especially when the old architecture or organizational \nstructure could not support the new business paradigm.  \nEvery organization need to understand block chain's unique benefits and focus only \non problems that it is best suited to solve. Wrong choices of blockchain platforms can \ncarry significant risks, as they could incur project cost overruns and delays, and miss \nthe opportunity for potential benefits. Table 1 provided some quick guidelines on how \nto make a \u201cwise\u201d selection.", "18 \n \nbecause DAG system needn\u2019t to synchronize. Considering there can be repeated \ntransactions in each slot, the improvement on TPS is not linear, but implementing this \nDAG data structure can improve the efficiency of the whole system. The nature of \nasynchronization also extends the scalability of the system. The difficulty of modifi-\ncation in this system is tremendous because there are many inputs and outputs in one \nslot and one modification can introduce a series of mistakes, so DAG system can \nprovide users with integrity. \n3.6 Solana \nSolana is a blockchain system which brings tremendous improvement to the perfor-\nmance of traditional bloc kchain and makes it possible to  build scalable and user -\nfriendly applications for the world. It possesses all attributes of traditional blockchain \nsystems but the performance is much better.  To improve performance of traditional \nblockchain system, Solana introduce the Proof of History mechanism. \nIn Solana system There are two kinds of nodes: Leader and Verifier. The Leader is \nan elected Proof of History generator, and Solana rotates leaders at fixed intervals.  \nThe components of Solana are shown in Fig.  12 The leader will receive the transac-\ntions coming from users and order them into a Proof of History sequence. \nProof of History is a mechanism used in Solana. The Proof of History sequence is a \nlist of transactions. The transactions are prearranged by a \u201cLeade r\u201d, and the \ntimestamp is embodied in this data structure. Every event has a unique hash and ac-\ncount along this data structure. As a function of real time, this info rmation tells us \nwhat event had come before another. For example, if we want to know the has h value \nwhen index is 300, the only way is to run this algorithm 300 times. We can know that \nthere is real time elapsing in this process from this specific data structure. Time can-\nnot be faked and the future can also not be forecasted. In this way, this sy stem will no \nlonger need to waste computing resources on synchronizing time, because time is \npreconfigured and unchangeable.  \n \nUser1 User2 User3\nLeader (PoH Sequence \nGenerator)\nTransaction3\nTransaction2\nTransaction1\nVerifier1\nVerifier2\nTransaction3\nBatch1\nBatch2"], "response": "Solana handles the synchronization of transactions between verifiers by breaking transactions into batches.

But this is more of a busi-\nness problem, as it may introduce changes to the business processes and the interac-\ntion patterns that need to be properly addressed from the strategy perspectives. \nScalability. To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in-\ntroduced, as discussed before. For example, with the  Lightning Network  [32] of \nBitcoin, a second layer to the main blockchain network is added in order to facilitate \nfaster transactions . Plasma [33] of Et hereum has a parent -child structure, processes \nthe transactions in the child -chain, and records the results in the parent -chain. Shar-\nding [34] groups subsets of nodes into smaller networks or \u2018shards\u2019 that are responsi-\nble for the transactions specific to t heir shard. When offered in conjunction with the \nproof-of-stake consensus mechanism, such mechanisms have the potential to scale up \nthe application. \nAs summarized in Table 1, private blockchain offer much better scalability, as the \nnodes in the network are purposely designed and enabled to process transactions in an \nenvironment of trusted parties. Therefore, some hybrid chains effectively combining \npublic chains for certain transactions, while employing private chains for other types \nof transactions would provide the best combination. \nIn addition, in almost all known business applications, it is not required to have \neveryone on the eco-system to participate or contribute to establish and maintain the \nintegrity of the distributed ledger.

From the original block structure to Merkel tree \nwith levels of hashed information, to DAG in Corda, it is evident that  significant im-\nprovements are still possible by innovating on underlying data structures that take ad-\nvantage of the representational characteristics of the transactions, especially their iden-\ntity information or business implications (\u201csmart ID\u201d[ 29]), business semantics [ 30], \ntemporal patterns [31], etc. With matching algorithms to enforce security and integrity, \nthey will definitely revolutionize the blockchain technology. In this regard, some self-\norganizing and potentially self-evolving structures\uff0c together with the help from artifi-\ncial intelligence and machine learning ( AI/ML), could be better fit while they could \nautomatically do only what\u2019s necessary and sufficient.  \nWith such innovative structures, algorithms can be further researched  that take ad-\nvantage of the full spectrum of analytical, stochastic and optimization, and of course \nAI/ML methods. Only in this way, the inefficiency of the cumbersome consensus and \nverification process prevailing in the current blockchain platforms can be  eventually \nsolved. \nData Models and Governance. As essentially \u201cevery company is a data company \u201d, \nblockchains potentially generate significant amount of new data to provide  the re-\nquired privacy and security , resilience and irreversibility. If bad data are offered cor-\nrectly or if the data store  contains false information but is offered right, they will all \nend up on the system.  \nAs some high impact incidences of data loss and breach were reported that could \ndiscourage companies from transitioning to blockchains, data governance has become \nmore critical. Poor execution of smart contracts could result in bad automated decision-\nmaking that could lead to tremendous business risks. Data privacy still remains as a \nchallenging issue while enterprise blockchain projects need to remedy. \nPerformance. As discussed earlier, the performance of a blockchain could be domi-\nnated by the least \u201cpowerful\u201d participating node in the network. So as Solana did, \nhow to effectively enforce some minimal standards on certain node capabilities, and \nfurther classify nodes into different groups with relevant rights and privileges without \nsacrificing the integrity assurance, could be appealing. It is even better if we can make \nsuch decisions adaptive to the business applications and workloads. \nIt is also feasible to off -load some heavy processing to a secondary support chain \nor system, while the main blockchain is only used to record the final result of the \ntransactions. For example, organizations always maintain some lists of \u201ctrusted\u201d or \n\u201ctrust-worthy\u201d clients, conducti ng transactions with those clients do not necessarily \nneed on-time completion of all the complex hashing operations for the entire distrib-\nuted ledger. Instead results from the off -loaded expensive operations only need to be \nreflected in the main chain, bas ed on the \u201ctrust -worthiness\u201d of the partners. Further-", "6 \n \nConsensus issues. The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system.

From the original block structure to Merkel tree \nwith levels of hashed information, to DAG in Corda, it is evident that  significant im-\nprovements are still possible by innovating on underlying data structures that take ad-\nvantage of the representational characteristics of the transactions, especially their iden-\ntity information or business implications (\u201csmart ID\u201d[ 29]), business semantics [ 30], \ntemporal patterns [31], etc. With matching algorithms to enforce security and integrity, \nthey will definitely revolutionize the blockchain technology. In this regard, some self-\norganizing and potentially self-evolving structures\uff0c together with the help from artifi-\ncial intelligence and machine learning ( AI/ML), could be better fit while they could \nautomatically do only what\u2019s necessary and sufficient.  \nWith such innovative structures, algorithms can be further researched  that take ad-\nvantage of the full spectrum of analytical, stochastic and optimization, and of course \nAI/ML methods. Only in this way, the inefficiency of the cumbersome consensus and \nverification process prevailing in the current blockchain platforms can be  eventually \nsolved. \nData Models and Governance. As essentially \u201cevery company is a data company \u201d, \nblockchains potentially generate significant amount of new data to provide  the re-\nquired privacy and security , resilience and irreversibility. If bad data are offered cor-\nrectly or if the data store  contains false information but is offered right, they will all \nend up on the system.  \nAs some high impact incidences of data loss and breach were reported that could \ndiscourage companies from transitioning to blockchains, data governance has become \nmore critical. Poor execution of smart contracts could result in bad automated decision-\nmaking that could lead to tremendous business risks. Data privacy still remains as a \nchallenging issue while enterprise blockchain projects need to remedy. \nPerformance. As discussed earlier, the performance of a blockchain could be domi-\nnated by the least \u201cpowerful\u201d participating node in the network. So as Solana did, \nhow to effectively enforce some minimal standards on certain node capabilities, and \nfurther classify nodes into different groups with relevant rights and privileges without \nsacrificing the integrity assurance, could be appealing. It is even better if we can make \nsuch decisions adaptive to the business applications and workloads. \nIt is also feasible to off -load some heavy processing to a secondary support chain \nor system, while the main blockchain is only used to record the final result of the \ntransactions. For example, organizations always maintain some lists of \u201ctrusted\u201d or \n\u201ctrust-worthy\u201d clients, conducti ng transactions with those clients do not necessarily \nneed on-time completion of all the complex hashing operations for the entire distrib-\nuted ledger. Instead results from the off -loaded expensive operations only need to be \nreflected in the main chain, bas ed on the \u201ctrust -worthiness\u201d of the partners. Further-", "3 \n \nScalability. Scalability is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is \none of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.   \nThe system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us-\ners/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to \nscale up and down quickly as the number of users change drastically, as needed.  \nSecurity and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality, authentication and \nintegrity ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected . \nBlockchain benefits primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se-\ncurity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates a flow of data from \ncomplex mathematical operations that cannot be changed once created  without being \ndetected, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi-\ncantly more reliable than traditional journal methods. This unchangeable and i ncor-\nruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains safer and better protected against \ntampering and hacking of information.  \nVarious software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua-\nble/transactional data at many integration points. System architects need to understand \nlegal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to the development \nteam, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.  \nWith blockchains , an external audit can be provided from the distributed ledger. \nThis will inherently enhance privacy and avoid corruption, and help confirm the legit-\nimacy of transactions and offer indisputable proof of transactions. \nAvailability/Reliability/Resilience. The system must be availab le for use, and the  \ndowntime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances . For ex-\nample, mechanisms to avoid single points of failures, and adequate timeouts could be \nused to enhance system availability and reliability.  \nFeasibility. Feasibility considers issues such as technology maturity , time-to-\nmarket, total cost of ownership , technical knowl edge, and migration requirements. \nCommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, managed services and cloud-native func-\ntions where appropriate, and close collaboration with development partners with suit-\nable architecture  and solution components and services wi ll definite ly help address \nthose issues. . \nThis paper surveyed several important blockchain platforms covering the years of \nevolution from the original Bitcoin system to the more advanced recent offerings. \nHopefully, with the information we collected and a nalyzed, it could help enterprises \nto make better decisions, while also directs new players where to innovate in order  to \nmake blockchain well fit into most enterprises business needs.  We will review the \nchosen frameworks, especially their data structure s, processes and algorithms in-\nvolved in creating a new transaction record (block), and how conflicts or disputes \ncould be resolved in Section 2 . We will also raise concerns on several key issues re-\nlated to the afore -mentioned NFRs, especially the performance  and scalability.

To improve scalabi lity, multi -layer or multi -chain systems could be in-\ntroduced, as discussed before.

It can also allow data sharing in a way that enforces pri-\nvacy and provides transparency into how data is being used.  \nHowever, for performance and usability reasons, it may still be valuable to  keep \nand manage one highly optimized system of record in a centralized database. \nDecentralized storage . Decentralized (cloud) storage creates a resilient file storage \nsharing system by partitioni ng and encrypting data, distributing it for storage on \ndrives on a peer -to-peer network. IPFS [46] and Storj [ 47] are such offerings that \nallow developers to store contents (data, web pages, etc.) with much -reduced band-\nwidth requirements, improved resilience and less impact of censorship.  \n \nStorj is another promising distributed storage technology that allows developers to \nencrypt files, split them into pieces and then distribute them across a global cloud \nnetwork. It is directly compatible with Amazon S3 s torage tools, which should make \nit easy for cloud developers to weave into applications without learning new tools. \n5 Conclusion \nIt is exciting to live in this wonderful world of technologies while innovations lead to \nnew business opportunities that in turn will present new issues calling for better solu-\ntions. This paper quickly surveyed some important issues hindering the broad enter-\nprise adoption for the blockchains, a breakthrough that could be served as the founda-\ntion of global business transactions and e xchanges, not only eliminating unnecessary \nintermediaries, but more importantly providing the guaranteed security and integrity \nof transaction information intrinsically and permanently. After some general descrip-\ntion, we analyzed 6 representative blockchai n platforms, emphasizing how each \nevolved to alleviate performance and scalability problems inherent in the original \ntechnology structure and algorithm stack. We then presented some quick guidelines \non how organizations can select a \u201cbest -proper\u201d platform to serve its current and fu-\nture business needs.  \nBroad adoption of blockchain still requires significant overhaul in many critical ar-\neas, and this paper summarized some of the potential improvement opportunities. As \nit may take a long time before blockchai n technology become mature and stable \nenough with the necessary transaction throughput, proper scalability and interopera-\nbility for enterprise applications, this paper finally presented some alternative tech-\nnology options. \n References \n1.

A simplified distributed ledger, without the com-\nplexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative \nfor trusted decentralized applications.

How can organizations select the best blockchain platform to meet their current and future business needs?", "contexts": ["2 \n \nchain market size is expected to grow from USD 3.0 billion in 2020 to USD 39.7 \nbillion in 2025, at a CAGR of 67.3% during 2020 -2025 [1]. As organizations have \nstarted to explore and experiment with blockchain\u2019s potential by developing block-\nchain applications, the proper choice of a \u201cgood\u201d blockchain platform becomes vital. \nAs they become increasingly more popular, enterprises need better information to \nmake right judgement calls to decide not only when to jump into the tech wago n, but \nmore importantly how they can take advantage of the new technology while avoiding \npotential pitfalls.  \nBlockchain and smart contracts make it possible for multiple parties to share busi-\nness logic and collaboratively conduct business processes/operations automatically. \nProperly utilized, it can  reduce IT costs, expand B2B and B2C networks, enable new \nproducts and service that could bring in revenue and profits . Moreover, blockchain's \nbusiness value is expected to increase as enterprise implementations proliferate and \nare further extended and refined.  \n1.2 Issues facing Enterprise Adoption of Blockchain Technology \nThis paper will not cover whether blockchain technology fits enterprises from the \nbusiness perspective, although that should be the first question to ask. We will focus \non non-functional requirements that describes the system\u2019s operation capabilities and \nconstraints that enhance its business functionality. The non -functional requirements \nneeded for application will of course depend on the business context and the out-\ncomes to be achieved, particularly as there are so many that can be applied. In this \npaper, we will only elaborate a few most critical ones. \nPerformance. All enterprise systems should be designed and built with an acceptable  \nstandard of performance as a minimum, while t aking into accoun ts problems such \nas scalability, latency, load and resource utilization. Many factors could negatively \nimpact p erformance, including  high numbers of API calls, poor caching, and high -\nload third-party services. It\u2019s critical  to ensure the end -user experience or integration \nof multi-systems across the entire eco-chain is not affected by any such issues. \nPrevailing business transaction systems have been capable of processing thousands \n(Visa, for example) or millions of transactions (online market place such as Amazon \nor Alibaba) per second without any failure, most of the cu rrent blockchain platform s \ndepicted a remarkable slowdown, making them unviable for large -scale or perf or-\nmance-sensitive applications. For example, Bitcoin can only process roughly 3 to 7 \ntransactions per second, with Ethereum about 15 to 20 transactions.  \nSuch poor performance and cumbersome  operations are  mainly d ue to the com-\nplexity with encrypted and distributed nature in blockchains. Although it is not at all \nsuitable for high-frequency transactions, ways to improve its transaction performance, \nincluding throughput and latency, is always a hot topic.  Compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d \npayment systems such as cash or debit cards , it could take hours or even days to pro-\ncess some transactions. When more users join the netwo rk, its performance will be \nfurther degraded due to the existence of consensus latency from nodes with low pro-\ncessing power. As a result, the transactions cost is higher than usual, further limiting \nmore users onto the network.", "3 \n \nScalability. Scalability is the second big issue that needs to be addr essed, as this is \none of the core reasons why organizations still hesitate to adopt blockchains.   \nThe system must be able to accommodate ever -increasing volumes (number of us-\ners/devices/integrated applications, data and throughput) over time, and is able to \nscale up and down quickly as the number of users change drastically, as needed.  \nSecurity and Integrity . Requirements such as  confidentiality, authentication and \nintegrity ensure that valuable  (private and confidential ) information is protected . \nBlockchain benefits primarily derive from the trust it fosters, its built -in privacy, se-\ncurity and data integrity and its transparency, as it incorporates a flow of data from \ncomplex mathematical operations that cannot be changed once created  without being \ndetected, and every transaction is encoded and connected, and therefore it is signifi-\ncantly more reliable than traditional journal methods. This unchangeable and i ncor-\nruptible characteristic inherently make blockchains safer and better protected against \ntampering and hacking of information.  \nVarious software engineering tactics can be employed to safeguard valua-\nble/transactional data at many integration points. System architects need to understand \nlegal and compliance requirements and communicate these clearly to the development \nteam, so that the necessary levels of security can be established and enforced jointly.  \nWith blockchains , an external audit can be provided from the distributed ledger. \nThis will inherently enhance privacy and avoid corruption, and help confirm the legit-\nimacy of transactions and offer indisputable proof of transactions. \nAvailability/Reliability/Resilience. The system must be availab le for use, and the  \ndowntime must be reduced to an acceptable level under any circumstances . For ex-\nample, mechanisms to avoid single points of failures, and adequate timeouts could be \nused to enhance system availability and reliability.  \nFeasibility. Feasibility considers issues such as technology maturity , time-to-\nmarket, total cost of ownership , technical knowl edge, and migration requirements. \nCommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, managed services and cloud-native func-\ntions where appropriate, and close collaboration with development partners with suit-\nable architecture  and solution components and services wi ll definite ly help address \nthose issues. . \nThis paper surveyed several important blockchain platforms covering the years of \nevolution from the original Bitcoin system to the more advanced recent offerings. \nHopefully, with the information we collected and a nalyzed, it could help enterprises \nto make better decisions, while also directs new players where to innovate in order  to \nmake blockchain well fit into most enterprises business needs.  We will review the \nchosen frameworks, especially their data structure s, processes and algorithms in-\nvolved in creating a new transaction record (block), and how conflicts or disputes \ncould be resolved in Section 2 . We will also raise concerns on several key issues re-\nlated to the afore -mentioned NFRs, especially the performance  and scalability.

The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed.", "13 \n \n EOS provides not only tools for DApps, but also solutions for scalability issues, \nwhich we will further discuss in Section 3.5.  EOS has the following three main fea-\ntures [19]:  \n1. Low latency. The platform supports low latency with DPoS mechanism. \n2. Parallel Performance. The off -load can allocated among multiple CPUs and \ncomputers in terms of large-scale applications. This avoid heavy on -chain \nworkload.  \n3. Sequential Performance. Due to some limitations in sequentially dependent \nsteps, those applications that cannot support parallel algorithms will be \nprovided with fast sequential processing for high volumes. \nBy deploying DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism  [20], this \npermissioned EOS blockchain has become suitable for not only public occasions, but \nalso private enterprise cases. The most representative enterprise cases include: \nDPOS is  an improved version of PoS  for permissioned purposes.  DPOS selects \nnodes (block producers)  as representatives to partake in later transaction validation \nwork [21]. At the initial stage of each round, a total of 21 block producers are selected \n(voted), among which 20 producers are chosen automatically while the remaining one \nwas chosen based on the voting proportion results of other producers. Then these 21 \nproducers will begin to validate blocks of transactions. As long as 15 producers out of \n21 reach consensus, a block is considered to be valid. \nIt is noticeable that the number of selected block producers, 21, is not an absolute \nunchangeable number. According to latest EOS Whitepaper, the number of super \nnodes can be voted by the community. However, why is number 21 chosen? \nFor the comprehensive consideration of efficiency and fairness, the DPoS consen-\nsus mechanism set up 21 super nodes as block producers. Firstly, there must be an \nodd number of nodes, because in EOS whitepaper, there is a \"most nodes  are just\" \nassumption, as well as a \u201clongest chain mechanism\u201d. The odd number of producers \ncan guarantee that only one longest chain exists.  \nSecondly, the originator, Daniel Larimer, first used 101 witness nodes when mak-\ning the first version of DPoS conse nsus mechanism, while in the upgraded version, \nthe number of 101 is changed to user -defined, so that people can freely adjust it when \nvoting. However, when a community is in a controllable state, the number of nodes \nthat can be voted is usually about 15. T herefore, when Daniel conducts the second \nDPoS project, the number of nodes is set slightly higher than 15 to 21, to ensure the \n\"decentralized\" operation under the controllable state. In EOS Whitepaper, there is a \nconfirmation of \"absolute irreversibility\", which requires the consent of more than 2/3 \nof the nodes. If the number of nodes is large, a longer waiting time is required for \nconfirmation. If the number of nodes is small, shorter waiting time is prone to some \nconcentration risks. It is understandabl e that 21 is a balance between decentralization \nand performance."], "response": "The advantages of Proof of Work (PoW) include incentivizing nodes to participate in transaction processing and ensuring security through computational work. However, PoW is criticized for its high energy consumption and inefficiency in terms of transaction processing speed. On the other hand, Proof of Stake (PoS) rewards miners based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, reducing energy consumption compared to PoW. Nevertheless, PoS can lead to centralization as wealthy miners have more influence.

The consensus algorithm is a mechanism that ensure all distributed \nuntrustworthy nodes keep the same ledger by mak ing recorded transactions immuta-\nble and maintain consistent state s. By impartially verifying and validating transac-\ntions, the nodes will be rewarded according to their efforts i n this process. Two core \nproof-based algorithms, PoW and PoS [5], bring in some basic issues to be addressed \nby later versions of consensus algorithms. \nProof of Work ( PoW). Proof of Work encourages nodes or users in the network to \ndevote their computational power for transaction process by rewarding them for their \nefforts [6]. If one node initiates a block of transactions, this block will have to be \nchecked with computations by all other nodes , the so called mining process  while the \nparticipating nodes are miners. Miners will contain a nonce when working out a hash \nvalue.  This value will eventually be tried out by adjusting nonce and thus a block is \nvalidated. \nSuch consensus mechanism will cause  huge waste of computing resource. The \nwhole network of miners will spend their best effort in working out only one hash \nvalue. Except the miner who first works it out and gets rewarded, other miners only \njust wastes their computing power. The efficiency of the mechanism is also low. The \ntime for the mining process wo uld be around 1 0 minutes with only one output, e too \nlow for the real-world business transactions. \nProof of Stake ( PoS). Proof of Stake is based on the amount of balance each miner \npossesses. As many miners may find validated blocks easier with comparativel y more \ncomputing ability, PoS is designed by reward ing miners with interests based on the \namount they own [7]. Their possessions are the \u201cstakes\u201d, and it is the stake that decide \nwho will mine the following blocks. There is no competition among miners, and \ntherefore computational waste is reduced to some extent. \nHowever, this mechanism is unreliable. As interests will be rewarded, some miners \nwill large amount of stake might be unwilling to contribute their computational ability \nand rely only on stakes. Thi s is negative trend that will give rise to lower mobility of \ntransactions. \nPerformance issues. From a technical point of view,  the typical blockchain network, \nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, requires consensus from all nodes in the whole net-\nwork. Even if a node completes its validation process, it has to wait for consents  from \nother nodes. For Bitcoin, the throughput rate is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and \nthe confirmation time is 60 minutes. Ethereum blockchain has a better performance \nwith dozens TPS. Such throughput can not satisfy large-scale enterprise applications. \nThis issue will be even more acute when more users/nodes join the network. \nScalability issues. The processing power of individual nodes largely determines the \nscalability of the blockchain system. For instance, when it comes to Bitcoin and \nEthereum, each core node in the network that participates in maintenance should \nmaintain a complete storage and be processed.", "18.

Considering there can be repeated \ntransactions in each slot, the improvement on TPS is not linear, but implementing this \nDAG data structure can improve the efficiency of the whole system.

The difficulty of modifi-\ncation in this system is tremendous because there are many inputs and outputs in one \nslot and one modification can introduce a series of mistakes, so DAG system can \nprovide users with integrity. \n3.6 Solana \nSolana is a blockchain system which brings tremendous improvement to the perfor-\nmance of traditional bloc kchain and makes it possible to  build scalable and user -\nfriendly applications for the world. It possesses all attributes of traditional blockchain \nsystems but the performance is much better.  To improve performance of traditional \nblockchain system, Solana introduce the Proof of History mechanism. \nIn Solana system There are two kinds of nodes: Leader and Verifier. The Leader is \nan elected Proof of History generator, and Solana rotates leaders at fixed intervals.  \nThe components of Solana are shown in Fig.  12 The leader will receive the transac-\ntions coming from users and order them into a Proof of History sequence. \nProof of History is a mechanism used in Solana. The Proof of History sequence is a \nlist of transactions. The transactions are prearranged by a \u201cLeade r\u201d, and the \ntimestamp is embodied in this data structure. Every event has a unique hash and ac-\ncount along this data structure. As a function of real time, this info rmation tells us \nwhat event had come before another. For example, if we want to know the has h value \nwhen index is 300, the only way is to run this algorithm 300 times. We can know that \nthere is real time elapsing in this process from this specific data structure. Time can-\nnot be faked and the future can also not be forecasted.

Setup, configuration, \ncommitments and conformance to performance, scalability, availability, and some-\ntimes even security and privacy still remains difficult and perplexing.   \n4.3 Alternatives to Bockchain Technology \nDespite its promises, blockchain adoption has been very slow. Several alternatives to \nblockchain that provide b etter performance have emerged, offering organizations \noptions to reduce costs, simplify development and reduce integration challenges while \nstill able to enjoy some of the core benefits of blockchains.  \nAlternative Distributed Ledgers . A simplified distributed ledger, without the com-\nplexities involved with the current blockchain technology, is definitely  an alternative \nfor trusted decentralized applications. Several options are available, including Hash-\ngraph, Iota Tangle and R3 Corda. \nIota and Hashgraph use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative data \nstructure for maint aining the ledger \uff0c while DAG approach allows an ap plication to \nwrite data quickly, and requires permission to conduct certain operations  that could \nslow down the transaction . The applications need to be configured to notify users \nwhen conflicts occur, and built-in rules rules to help resolve. \nAn Iota Tangle stores data across a DAG where each node, or vertex, represents a \ntransaction. The network grows via transactions rather than through a compute -\nintensive mining process. Iota supports micropayments and transactions across IoT \ndevices. It is mostly decentralized, but it does require a coordinator node that oversees \nand confirms the addition of new transactions. \nHashgraph also eliminates the need  for mining to grow the ledger by utilizing its \n\u201cgossip about gossip \u201d protocol that network nodes use to share i nformation, come to \nconsensus (another key process in blockchain) and add new transactions to the DAG. \nAs new data is added, an audit trail is also appended to the distributed ledger.  \nCentralized ledgers. Amazon's Quantum Ledger Database simplifies the pr ocess of \nimplementing a shared database designed for ledger -like applications that provides a \ncryptographically verifiable audit trail without all the overhead of a distributed ledger \nor blockchain. It promises the  immutability and verifiability of blockchain  combined \nwith the ease and scalability of a traditional cloud service \u3002One thing worth noting is \nthat the blockchain could still be a better option with untrusted players. \nDistributed databases. Distributed databases offer ome combination of data replica-\ntion and duplication to ensure data consistency and integrity . For examp le, the Or-\nbitDB [45] open source project was built on top of a distributed filesystem that allows \noperation even if one node goes down,  and  can support the creation of a dis tributed, \npeer-to-peer databases, and it enables organizations to develop decentralized applica-"], "response": "Solana, as a blockchain platform, introduces the Proof of History mechanism to improve performance.
